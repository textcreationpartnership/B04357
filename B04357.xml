            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Why men lived longer in former ages, than now in theſe days.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>LL thoſe that are ſtudious in Divine Writ may read, that in the time of the firſt age and before that for ſin a generall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge came over the earth, mans life then was longer than it is at this preſent. It is certain that <hi>Adam</hi> lived nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty years, <hi>Seth</hi> nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twelve, <hi>Cain</hi> nine hundred and ten. And deſcending from the one unto the other, the ſhorteſt of their lives was ſeven hundred years; and in theſe
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:175728:5"/>times we ſee few attain to fourſcore or ninety years, and if ſome one paſſe that, it is rare and marvellous, ſo that we come not to the tenth of the age of former men.</p>
               <p>The learned, either Divines or Philoſophers, who have diſcourſed thereupon, ſeeing that nature that brings us forth now, is the ſame that it was in times paſt, and that thoſe firſt men lived ſo long by nature, and not miracle, became aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereat, and have curiouſly ſearched out the cauſes and reaſons, as <hi>Marcus Varro,</hi> and an infinite number of others, who have found theſe things ſo difficult in natures appearance, that they have thought the years in ancient times not to be the ſame with ours in theſe modern times: which opinion and belief, is a great and vain errour, as will be made appear in this following Chapter. The truth is, when I ſee the works of others, and deſcend to that which agrees with my opinion, that the principall reaſon why men live not ſo long now a days as formerly, is that the Ancients had not in their times the cauſes that engender now in us thoſe diſeaſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by comes ſo ſoon old age and death. Then we muſt conſider, that the firſt Parents of all humane linnage, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> were created by the immediate hand of God, without any other means or help; and therfore it is preſumed that he created them of a moſt excellent complexion, perfect Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie and proportion of humours, which cauſed them to live in health ſo long and many years.</p>
               <p>By means whereof the children that proceed from Parents ſo full of health, muſt needs reſemble their Progenitors, in the ſame good and healthful complexion, as men deſcended of excellent matter, even till the change of ages, (the property whereof is to change and impair all things) all humane kind began to grow weaker, and the days of men to grow ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Now in thoſe times there was one thing that made much toward their long life, which in theſe times is very hurtfull and contrary to us, which was their great temperance in drink, both in quality and quantitie, and the ſmall varietie of meats; for they had not of ſo many ſorts as now we have, nor with ſo many inventions of cooking. We do nor find that before
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:175728:5"/>the Deluge, men knew what it was to eat fleſh: beſides, ſome hold it for certain, that the fruits and hearbs were of far greater virtue and ſubſtance without compariſon than now they are: becauſe then they proceeded out of new earth, and not as it is at this day, weak, weary, and as it were fallow: for the Deluge was the cauſe of taking away its fat, leaving it more infertile with a ſalt ſavour, leſſe perfect by the inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sea, which floted for many weeks over it. All theſe reaſons are, and every one of them ſufficient (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there are more if they were all put together) to prove that this is no ſtrange thing but naturall, that men lived long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then, than in theſe times. Moreover, it is to be noted, (and we hold it for certain) that <hi>Adam</hi> knew all the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of Hearbs, Plants, and precious Stones, and his children learned from him more than any man could learn ſince. This was in part for health, and the ſupport of life, and to cure diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, if peradventure any ſhould happen, by uſing ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies as were ſimple and perfect, and leaving out venemous compoſitions, uſed in theſe preſent times; the which inſtead of purging and cleanſing, weaken and kill thoſe that take them: and which is more in thoſe former times, the life and health of man was more ſupported and helped, by the courſe of the heavens, and influence of the Stars, more benevolent in thoſe times, than they are now; becauſe they had not paſſed ſo many aſpects, conjunctions, eclipſes, and other celeſtiall impreſſions, from whence are proceeded theſe alterations, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations and changes upon the earth: and amongſt the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, principall occaſions of life and health in thoſe former times, and on the contrary infirmities and death in theſe. But above all that that we have ſaid and founded upon naturall reaſon, I maintain that the cauſe of the long life of men in thoſe days, proceeded from the providence of God, who would have their lives ſuch, and that the occaſions aforeſaid might help one the other, to the end, that onely of two might be bred many, that the earth might be filled and human kind multiplied. So we ſee that men not living ſo long after the Deluge as before God ſuffered them to go into the ark, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:175728:6"/>ſo ſaved more men and women then he did create at the firſt to the end that the world might be repleniſhed more eaſily. St. <hi>Augustine</hi> ſpeaking of theſe things, ſayeth. That our fore-Fathers had the advantage of us, not onely in health and long life, but alſo in ſtature of body, as it is evident in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sepulchres, and bones which have been found under great Mountains; ſo that one may verily believe they were the bones of men living before the Deluge. The ſame St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> affirms, that being in <hi>Vtica</hi> a Town in <hi>Affrica,</hi> he did ſee the bones of a humane body, which had the Jaws as great and as heavy as of an hundred men of our age. And never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe although our life be ſo ſhort, yet ought we not to complain, becauſe applying it in evil, and to the contempt and neglect of God, the Lord is mercifull unto us in ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening it, for we ſhal ceaſe to be wicked any more: and yet if we will ſerve him, we have time enough to do ſo, for as much as the goodneſſe of God is ſo great, that he takes for payment the good deſires, and the will.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>That the opinion of thoſe which think the years in times paſt, to have been ſhorter then theſe in our times is falſe. Which was the firſt Town in the World. And that the Ancients had more children than are named in the holy Scripture.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecauſe it hath ſeemed to ſome, that the age of nine hundred years of men in former times was impoſſible, though they could not comprehend nor admit of the naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons thereof, which are alledged in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chapter. And not daring to deny ſuch number of years, ſo clearly manifeſted by holy writ, (they ſay) that the years in thoſe times, were ſhorter than the years now in our days. So that the long life which they
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:175728:6"/>enjoyed in thoſe days beyond us now, was not ſo great as is cried up. Some amongſt them would make us believe, that one of our years now, equals ten of theirs in times paſt. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them ſay, that every Moon makes a year, and have called them Lunary years. Some others of our opinion, That three of our moneths makes one of their years. And by this means four of their years equalled but one of ours. Becauſe in this ſort the Caldeans, and the Arcadians divided their years, as <hi>Lactantius</hi> recites in his ſecond book of Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, And <hi>Marcus Varro</hi> a learned Roman in many things (except in this) was of opinion, that the Lunary years, took their number from the conjunction of one Moon to the other, which conſiſts of 29 days and odde hours. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>Plinie</hi> holds for a fable the long life of the Ancients or firſt of men, and ſays, that thoſe of Arcadia counted their years, as we have before recited, of three of our moneths.</p>
               <p>There is even yet amongſt us Chriſtians,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eliconien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe,</hi> 1 Book of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</note> a book of the Age of the World, whereof <hi>Elicontenſis</hi> is Authour, where it ſeems that he is of this opinion. Nevertheleſs, it is moſt clear, That the years that were quoted in the holy Scripture, were ſuch as theſe that we have now in theſe times: Which <hi>Ioſephus</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and proves; and ſo <hi>Lactantius Firmian:</hi> but much better, and more diſtinctly St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> whoſe Reaſons and Authority will confute all the falſe opinions which have ſmelt or ſavoured of the contrary.</p>
               <p>As for the firſt, which is, That every Moon made then a year, to take it from one Conjunction to another, it is a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt error; becauſe, we know very well, that ſuch a ſpace of time contains not full thirtie days, ſo that in that caſe, an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years now, would amount to more than twelve hundred years then; from whence would grow (againſt the opinion of all the World) that men ſhould live longer now than they did then, foraſmuch as there was not then found a man, which lived twelve hundred years; which ariſeth not to one of our Ages. And nevertheleſs, we may find ſome that have lived an hundred, and an hundred and twelve years, which would be more than thirteen hundred years, to reckon the years by
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:175728:7"/>the Moons. Is it not alſo a folly in them, which affirm, that ten of thoſe years in times paſt, countervailed but one of ours at preſent; for if their affirmation were true, men in thoſe days, would have had ſtrength to beget children at ſeven, eight, and ten years, which is againſt all natural Philoſophie,</p>
               <p>That it is ſo,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Gen. </seg>5</label> we read in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> That <hi>Seth,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Adam,</hi> begat <hi>Enos</hi> at the age of an hundred and five years: If therefore ten years then, had made but one of our years now, it muſt needs follow, that men in thoſe former ages, begat children at ten years and an half old, of theſe preſent times. <hi>Cain</hi> alſo begetting children at ſeventy years, would by that reckoning, have been a Father at ſeven years of our age. And nevertheleſs, we ſhould find much leſſe, if one of our years now, made twelve then, as ſome of them affirm. Their falſe opinions ſhall be made yet more clear by this enſuing dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. If their year were but the tenth or twelth part of ours now, it would follow, that the year had not twelve moneths, or the moneth but three days,

               <p>As for that other opinion of thoſe that ſay, The years of old times, made the fourth part of a year of our times now, and that the year conſiſted of three moneths; the ſame Scripture likewiſe declares that to be falſe; foraſmuch as in the ſame place it ſaith, That the Ark of <hi>Noah</hi> floated upon the waters, and that the ſeven and twentieth day of the ſeventh moneth, it reſted, becauſe the waters were abated, and it reſted it ſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the mountains of <hi>Ararat.</hi> A little after he ſaith, that the waters decreaſed daily, even till the tenth moneth, and that the firſt day of the moneth, the tops of the mountains began to appear. By this it appears, their opinion is errour, that ſay, the year conſiſted but of three moneths, ſeeing it names the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth and the tenth. We may ſee then, that the ancient years had twelve moneths, in that it names the tenth moneth, and doth not ſay the laſt: And as ill may one ſay, the moneth to have but three days; for the text carries it expreſly, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:175728:7"/>and twentieth day of the moneth: Yet leſſe may one ſay the day to have but two or three hours; becauſe the ſame text ſaith, that it rained, and the windows of Heaven were open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſpace of fourty days and fourty nights: ſo that it is clear, that the daies were natural, of four and twentie hours, and the moneths, and the years as long as now, or little leſſe: I ſay it, becauſe they kept reckoning of the courſe of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens as we do; ſo that the ſame order hath been alwaies kept a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Learned, as well <hi>Hebrews</hi> as <hi>Egyptians,</hi> amongſt whom <hi>Moſes</hi> was brought up a Hiſtoriographer, and Authour of thoſe holy Books, in which are writ the Chronicles of thoſe long lives. And now, if we would yield to the opinion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, which hold, that the <hi>Hebrews</hi> reckoned the moneths by the Moons, and that the year was twelve Lunarie moneths, and that every moneth contained twentie nine days, and four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hours, a few more, or a few leſs, and that the year was ſhorter by twelve dayes, than that which we reckon by the courſe of the Sun, which is three hundred ſixtie five daies, and ſix hours; yet this difference ſhall not make us doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, or uncertain of the lives of our ancient Fathers; for this is but a ſmall matter in nine hundred or a thouſand years, to fail twenty or thirtie, the Lunarie moneth not accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thirtie daies. By this authoritie then we are certain, that the nine hundred and thirtie years that <hi>Adam</hi> lived, and the nine hundred years of others, were the ſame, as the hundred and ſeventie five of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the ſeventie, or eightie that men live now in theſe daies; he that ſhall beleeve other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe is in an errour. There is likewiſe another conſideration to be noted, alledged by St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to this purpoſe, which is, Put the caſe, that the Scripture makes not mention, that <hi>Adam</hi> and his had other children before thoſe which are there named; yet it is to be beleeved, that before and after, they had many, in condition, at younger years than the Scripture makes mention they could have children; and to make there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a more ample proof, when it is ſaid, that <hi>Cain</hi> had built a Town,

                  </note> (the firſt that was in the World) whereof <hi>Ioſephus</hi> ſpeaks, ſaying, That it had Towers, and that it was walled
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:175728:8"/>round, and that he named it after his ſons name, <hi>Henoc,</hi> which was newly born unto him: It is very unlikely, that there was then in the World, but three or four men onely, (yet the Scripture makes no mention of any more) becauſe to build ſuch a Town, would require the help of a great number of men, albeit the text names but the principal and chief that built it, as appears when is ſaid, That their ſons and their daughters begat others, which are not named. We ſee the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Evangeliſts have done the like in their Evangelical Hiſtory; for St. <hi>Matthew</hi> treating of the linage of Chriſt, according to the fleſh, begins at <hi>Abraham,</hi> and willing to reckon even unto <hi>David,</hi> ſaith, [<hi>Abraham</hi> begat <hi>Iſaac</hi>] uſing no words of <hi>Iſhmael;</hi> a little after, [<hi>Iſaac</hi> begat <hi>Iacob</hi>] ſpeaking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of <hi>Eſau,</hi> although he were the firſt-born, becauſe having an intention to come by degrees even to <hi>David,</hi> which was not of the Line of <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> he reckons neither <hi>Iſhmael</hi> nor <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau.</hi> Afterwards [<hi>Iacob</hi> begat <hi>Iudas</hi> and his brethren,] and yet <hi>Iudas</hi> was not the eldeſt.

                  <p>That the ſign of the Croſſe was in eſtimation before our Saviour Chriſt was crucified.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Ong time before our Saviour and Redeemer Jeſus Chriſt ſuffered upon the Croſſe, the ſign of the Croſſe was in eſteem, as a Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtick ſign and fatall; eſpecially by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians and Arabians. The Egyptians engraved it upon the breſt of their Idoll <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapis</hi> which they adored for their God. But better to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:175728:8"/>how this figure came in ſuch veneration. You muſt underſtand that the ancient Arabes, moſt skilfull in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the heavens and the force of the Stars, made for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers cauſes, Images and Figures graven in Stone, Mettals, Rings and other things; obſerving thereby certain points, and certain days: amongſt which ſigns, this of the croſſe was by them moſt eſteemed, attributing thereunto more virtue and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy than any of the others; and eſteemed reverently of it, in their houſes, and other private places. Now let us ſet a part the reſpect that we may have of it. In that thereupon was made our Redemption, as <hi>Facinus</hi> writes, and let us conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this figure of the Croſſe by it ſelf, in contemplation of Geometry, it will be found an excellent and perfect figure, becauſe it conteins equal length and breadth. It is compoſed of two ſtreight lines equall, the joining whereof, taken at the Center (to the extreameſt of each end) makes a perfect round, it conteins in it four ſtreight corners, and therefore in it are the greateſt effects of the Stars; becauſe they have the greateſt force and virtue, then when they are in their extreameſt, and corners of the <hi>East, West North,</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> and ſo ſeated, form (by the ſplendor that they give) the figure of a croſſe, all which things are conſiderable: Beſides, it is not amiſſe to note the reaſons why the Egyptians eſteemed it amongſt their other notes and figures, and what they ſignified by it. But I will ſpeak firſt of ſome of the Figures, and Hieroglifiques of Egypt, and their ſignifications. Before the Egyptians had let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, they writ their conceptions by Figures, Characters, and Ciphers of divers things, as Trees, Birds, and Beaſts, or by ſome of their particular members, in which they were ſo cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and accuſtomed, that they quickly learned to know what every thing ſignified, by the great experience which they had made, which the children learned from their Parents, and one from another by ſucceſſion. <hi>Cornelius Tacitus, Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo Diodorus,</hi> and <hi>Plinie,</hi> in many places gives reaſons hereof.</p>
               <p>Firſt, by the Figure of a vulture, they underſtood na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, becauſe ſay they of this ſort of bird is found no Male,

                  </note> By the Sparrow-hawk or Falcon, they ſignified any thing that was done with great diligence, becauſe of the readineſſe and ſwiftneſſe of theſe Birds. The Honey <hi>Bee,</hi> ſignified a King; becauſe a King ought to have ſweetneſſe and a ſting. By the Serpent <hi>Baſilisk</hi> hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his tale in his mouth, they underſtood the revolution of the year; becauſe it ends where it began. The head of a Wolf ſhewed the Time paſt; becauſe this beaſt hath no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance. The head of a Lion, the time preſent; becauſe of his ſtrength and power. The head of a Dog licking and made ſharp to ſignifie the time future; for alwaies we cheriſh him and uſe him kindly in hope. The Ox ſignified the earth; becauſe of the great pains this beaſt taketh. Juſtice was ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified in the Stork, becauſe it is ſaid this bird ſuſteins and nouriſhes the old ones in their age, in acknowledgment to have been bred and brought up by them in the neſt. They demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated Envy by an Eel; becauſe it accompanies not with other fiſh. The bountifull man was declared by the right hand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and on the contrary, the covetuous man by the left hand ſhut. The Crocodile, which is a very noiſome beaſt, ſignified the malicious man. The eye open did denote a man obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving juſtice. By the Ear, they underſtood memory. To ſhew a man of great memory, they painted a Hare having his ears open; and ſo diſcourſing of all things, they practiſed theſe Figures, as though they had been to them written letters. Now let us return to our purpoſe of the Croſſe. It is ſtrange that amongſt ſo many ſigns and figures, this was the moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and known figure or character, yea even to be placed upon the breaſt of their God, to ſignifie the hope of the hour which was to come: and as it were to prognoſticate the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſalvation, which thereby ſucceeds unto us: ſo ſays <hi>Ruffinus</hi> in his Eccleſiaſticall hiſtory, <hi>Marcellus</hi> and others. Here you ſee how the croſſe was in eſteem amongſt that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But on the contrary, amongſt the Jews, Romans, and other people, the death upon the Croſſe was reputed ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious. And the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was the firſt, that forbad any perſon condemned to death ſhould be crucified,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:175728:9"/>for the honour he bare to the holy Croſſe. But ordeined the contrary, that it ſhould be honoured and reverenced of all; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God had ſhewed him a Croſſe in the air, with promiſe of victory, ſo that under this ſign and hope of the promiſe, he fought with his enemie <hi>Maxentius,</hi> a Perſecutor of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and overcame him, as is recited by <hi>Euſebius.</hi> So the Emperour <hi>Theodoſius</hi> (though it be not obſerved to this day) ordeined that the ſign of the Croſſe ſhould not be engraven in ſtone or in metal, to be placed afterwards in any place where it might be broken or defaced, becauſe ſuch ſubſtances are apt to break, and he would perpetuate them unto us.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the excellency of keeping Counſell, and how it ought to be kept, with ſome good examples to that purpoſe.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ne of the principall things which makes a man known to be wiſe, is that he can keep counſel, &amp; be ſecret in that which hath been declared unto him by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to keep his own proper affairs ſilent. Thoſe that ſhall read ancient Hiſtories, will find infinite good enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes to have failed of their deſired end either in peace or in war, for want of keeping counſel, and thereupon have followed an infinite number of miſchiefs. But among all examples we wil conſider one notable above all the reſt, as proceeding from God, who ſo well keeps his own counſell, that he lets not any one know, (whatſoever he be) what ſhall happen to morrow. Nor thoſe of times paſt could ever know what ſhould happen at this hour. So in truth we may ſee that God himſelf hath loved ſecreſie. For albeit he ſhould declare, or hath declared ſome things, yet is it not poſſible for any to make him alter his will, For this cauſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:175728:10"/>men have always loved to do their buſineſs ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. We read that <hi>Cato Cenſor,</hi> would often ſay to his friends, that he always repented of three things, if at any time he ſhould happen to do any of them. The firſt, if he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare aſecret to any one, eſpecially to a woman. The ſecond, to have travelled by Sea when he might have gone by Land. And the third, if he ſhould ſpend one day idly without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming ſome vertuous act,. The two laſt deſerves to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but the firſt ſerves to our purpoſe. <hi>Alexander</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from his mother a letter of ſome importance, and after he had read it in the preſence of <hi>Hepheſtion,</hi> he cloſed up his mouth with his Seal-Ring, wherewith he was wont to ſeal his moſt ſecret letters, whereby he ſhewed, that he to whom one reveals his ſecrets ſhould have his mouth ſealed up. When King <hi>Liſymachus</hi> bid the Poet <hi>Philipides</hi> ask what he would and it ſhould be granted, the Poet anſwered him, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt good you can do me, is that you communicate not to me any of your ſecrets. <hi>Antonius Sebellicus</hi> writes a notable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to this purpoſe. In the time of Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> ſaith he, The Senate of <hi>Venice</hi> had a Captain named <hi>Cremignol,</hi> by whoſe treaſon &amp; means the whole army wasdiſcomfited. By means whereof the Senators aſſemble to determin what ſhould be done in this caſe. Some adviſed that he ſhould be ſent for &amp; apprehended, and receive juſtice; others were of the contrary o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion. At the laſt it was concluded that there ſhould be no notice taken of his fault, waiting for a better opportunity: all agreeing nevertheleſſe that he ſhould ſuffer death for his fault. This concluſion and occaſion was deferred for eight moneths, with ſuch ſecrecy, that there was no ſpeech of it during all that time, which was a marvellous thing ſeeing there were ſo many Senators, whereof there was many of them great friends to <hi>Cremignol,</hi> and many of them poor, which had received from him many gifts and much riches, yet gave him no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement. Nevertheleſs this thing was kept ſecret among them, till thoſe eight moneths were paſt. Then it was ordein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he ſhould come for <hi>Venice,</hi> where the Senate recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him with great welcomming and loving embracings.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:175728:10"/>And the next morning he was apprehended, and condemned to be beheaded, which was done accordingly. This may ſerve for an example to all our Modern Senators, Judges, and Counſellours, that it may not happen to them as it hath done to ſome, which have by and by diſcovered thoſe ſecrets which they ought to have concealed; to the ſhame of whom I will tell you a pleaſant diſcourſe of <hi>Aulus Gaelius</hi> in his Attique nights, and by <hi>Macrobius</hi> in his Saturnals, which is thus.</p>
               <p>The Senators of Rome, when they entred into the Senate-houſe, had a cuſtome to bring every one of them along with them, one of their children ſo ſoon as he could go, and the children of the noblemen had this priviledge, even to the age of ſeventeen years, that being accuſtomed to ſee the good orders that their fathers kept there, afterward coming at age to govern they might be the better inſtructed in publick affairs: theſe children nevertheleſſe, were ſo well inſtructed and taught, that they kept preciſely the ſecrets that were there treated of. It happened one day amongſt the Senate was put a matter to treat on of great conſequence, ſo that they ſtayed long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the houſe that day than they were accuſtomed, and yet were forced to defer the determination of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter till the next day forbidding, to ſpeak any thig of it in the mean time in any ſort.</p>
               <p>Now amongſt the children that were brought thither that day, there was one young child, ſon to the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour <hi>Papyrius,</hi> who was of one of the moſt illuſtrious and famouſeſt family in Rome. At the childs return home, the Mother would know of him, what buſineſſe that was, that was treated of there that day, that kept them there ſo late: to whom the child anſwered, It was a thing that he might not declare, and that he was forbidden to ſpeak any thing of it. The Mother hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this anſwer (as it is the cuſtome of women) was much more deſirous to know it than before, ſo that at firſt by fair means and promiſes, ſhe aſſayed to draw it from him, and at laſt by threatnings and beating would conſtrain him, which to avoid the child deviſed a pretty ſhift,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:175728:11"/>and told her, that which was in debate and would be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the next day was, that it ſeemed good to divers of the Senators as well for the publick good, as for the increaſe of people, that every man ſhould have two wives, and that there were ſome that were of the contrary opinion, maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that every woman ought rather to have two husbands, and that the next day it would be reſolved on. Which when the mother heard ſhe believed, and was mightily moved thereat, which cauſed her to advertiſe the reſt of the Roman Dames, that they might provide to hinder, that men ſhould not have two wives, but rather women might have two husbands. Hereupon the day following, a great number of the Matrons of Rome, came to the door of the Senate, praying and requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Senators effectually not to make ſo unjuſt a law, as that one man might marry two wives, and that it would be better to make the contrary. The Senators which knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing were abaſhed in ſuch ſort, that entring one after another into the Senate houſe, enquired of one another, from whence proceeded that diſhoneſt incivillity of their wives, but no one of them could give a reaſon.</p>
               <p>At the laſt little <hi>Papyrius</hi> put them out of their pain, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring in full councel what had hapned to him with his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and for fear that ſhe put him into, he was conſtrained to uſe this deceipt towards her. This being heard by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators they greatly commended the conſtancy of this little child, Nevertheleſſe, they ordered that they ſhould bring their children no more to the Senate, onely this <hi>Papyrius</hi> who was admitted to enter.</p>
               <p>Certainly the old men in theſe times, may take example by this diſcreet youth, and conſider, that if a private ſecret ought to be kept, much more a publick, and eſpecially among peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of age and judgement. <hi>Brutus Caeſſius,</hi> and all thoſe that conſpired the death of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> becauſe they ſaw it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for the profit and the liberty of their Country, fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined it, but would not let <hi>Cicero</hi> know of it, one of their great friends, and one that deſired more than any in Rome the abolition of that Tyrannie, not for any diſtruſt they had
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:175728:11"/>in him, but becauſe he was not reputed a good counſel keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, a ſecret worthy admiration ſeeing there were ſo many conſpirators, and nevertheleſſe they concealed it ſo long from him their ſingular friend.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fulvius</hi> declares a great ſecret to his wife, which had been communicated to him by the Emperour <hi>Octavian,</hi> which being diſcovered by the wife, and came to the ears of the Prince, the Senator was ſharply reprehended for his lightneſſe by his Lord, whereby growing in diſpair, determined to kill himſelf; wherefore upbraiding his wife of the wrong which ſhe had done him, ſhe anſwered him, he had no reaſon to be angry with her, ſeeing that during ſo long time as they had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved together, he could not take notice of her light temper, or having known it, would abuſe it in truſting her with ſuch a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. Wherefore though her husband was the cauſe of her fault, yet ſhe determined to ſuffer firſt, and indeed preſently killed her ſelf, and ſo did her husband after her.</p>
               <p>We read in the life of <hi>Nero</hi> that when his death was plotted in Rome, (a thing very neceſſary to the Romans, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his ſtrange cruelties) he which had the charge to give him the blow, meeting by chance one who was led priſoner, by the Ordinance of the Tyrant, and conſidering with himſelf that the perverſe nature of the Emperour was ſuch, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he cauſed to be apprehended never ſcaped death, and therefore this poor priſoner (which ſhed tears in abundance) could not eſcape it, came to him, and not conſidering of what importance it was to him to keep counſel, ſaid unto him, I pray God keep thee till to morrow, for if thou ſcape this day, I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnre thee <hi>Nero</hi> cannot put thee to death. Which the priſoner un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, ſuſpected the cauſe to be as indeed it was, and ſo found out the means to ſave his life, by declaring it to <hi>Nero,</hi> bidding him have a care of himſelf. Who ſent preſently to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him that comforted the priſoner, and by extream tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made him to confeſs the Plot, and ſo he loſt his life, and their deſign was loſt. <hi>Plinie</hi> reports the quite contrary of <hi>Anaxarchus,</hi> for being taken for ſuch a like thing, he bit off his tongue with his teeth; becauſe he would not declare a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:175728:12"/>and ſpit it in the Tyrants face. The Athenians cauſed the Statue of a Lyon made in braſſe, to be ſet up in the honour of a woman whoſe name was Lion, in memory of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, in keeping ſecret a conſpiracy, and this Statue had no tongue to denote ſecreſie. The ſervants and ſlaves of <hi>Planeus</hi> are alſo much commended, in that there was not torments ſufficient to make them confeſſe to the enemies of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter (who ſought to kill him) in what place he was hid. The ſervant of <hi>Cato</hi> having ſeen his Maſter commit ſome fault, was put to great torment to make him ſpeak, and yet they could never make him bear ſuch teſtimony againſt his Maſter. <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> recounts, that the Perſians held it inviolable to puniſh grievouſly (and more than for any other offence) he that revealed any ſecret; for confirmation whereof, he ſays, that King <hi>Darius</hi> being overcome by <hi>Alexander,</hi> and not knowing whither to flie, hid himſelf: but there was no tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that could be inflicted upon them that knew it, nor any hope of recompence could make them reveal it to any perſon. And ſayth, that the Perſian held an opinion, that none ought to be truſted with any thing of conſequence, that cannot keep a ſecret. Secrecy then is neceſſary in all matters, principally in War, which the valiant Captains of old obſerved very well. <hi>Philip</hi> ſon to <hi>Antigonus,</hi> ſucceſſour to <hi>Alexander,</hi> asked his father (in the preſence of ſome) when the army ſhould move, to whom the King replied in anger, Art thou ſo deaf that thou feareſt thou ſhalt not hear the Trumpets with the reſt; wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to make him underſtand thereby that he had made a fault in asking that queſtion, which muſt not be anſwered in the preſence of witneſſes. There was one <hi>Mettellus</hi> a Tribune of Cicily, in the army a Roman Captain came to him and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him what he had determined concerning the war; to whom <hi>Mettellus</hi> anſwered, if I thought my ſhirt knew, I would take it of and burn it preſently. <hi>Horace</hi> amongſt the laws of feſtivals, wils that every one keep ſecret the things that are there done and ſpoken. To this purpoſe the Athenians had a cuſtome, when they met at a feaſt, the ancienteſt in the company, ſhewed all the reſt the door at which they came in,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:175728:12"/>bidding them take heed, that by any means not a word of any thing that ſhould be there done or ſpoken, ſhould go out beyond that door. The firſt thing that <hi>Pythagorus</hi> taught his Schollars was to be ſilent, wherefore he kept them a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time without ſpeaking, to the end that he might teach them to keep counſel, and not to ſpeak but in fit time, which ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the virtue of ſecreſie was the rareſt.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> was demanded what ſeemed to him the moſt difficult thing of all, he anſwered, to keep ſilence. To this purpoſe St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in his offices, puts among the principal fundamentals of virtue, the patience of ſilence. The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans amongſt other of the vanities of their Gods, had one a Deeſſe of ſilence, named <hi>Angeron,</hi> which they painted with her finger in her mouth, in ſign of ſilence.

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O ſpeak little, and in that little to be ſuccinct and ſhort is a great virtue, and very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable for all men to know. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, that much ſpeech cannot be without much in, and he tht refrains his tonge is wiſe. And again he that keeps his tongue guards his ſoul. And on the contrary, he that ſpeaks inconſiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, gives himſelf a prey to many miſchiefs, one might bring here the teſtimony of many learned men. But the text in the holy Evangeliſts ſhall ſerve us, where it is ſaid that we are bound to give an account for every idle word. The <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi> amongſt all the Nation of the Greeks, delighted moſt to ſpeak ſhort in ſuch ſort, that if any were ſuccinct in his ſpeech, one would ſay preſently he ſpake Laconian. <hi>Philip</hi> the father of <hi>Alexander</hi> demanded to paſs through their Country with his army, and in what manner they would have him paſs a friend or an enemy. To whom they anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed briefly and without many words, neither the one, nor the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> King of Aſia, threatned likewiſe that he would come and ſack and pillage them, to which threatnings they anſwered, come and do what you will. My thinks they could not in many words have anſwered more gravely, The Ambaſsadors of the Samians made a long ſpeech in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory, ſo that the Auditours being wearied with ſuch a long diſcourſe, gave them this anſwer, We have forgot the firſt part of your propoſitions, and for the reſt we cannot underſtand it. Again, the other Ambaſsadors of the Abderits, for that they affected too much the expoſition of their Ambaſsage, and deſiring their diſpatch for a return, was anſwered by <hi>Agis</hi> King of the Lacedomonians, Tell the Abderits we have heard
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:175728:13"/>you all along, and as long as you would ſpeak. A man once ſpeaking to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> held him with ſuch a long prolix diſcourſe, that himſelf finding his own fault, concluded with an excuſe that he would pardon him, that he had uſed ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny words to ſo wiſe a Philoſopher, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> anſwered him very mildly, Brother, you need not ask me pardon, for I was thinking of another matter, wherein <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> payed him, and anſwered in few words to purpoſe. We have another example of the Theeves that robbed and killed the Poet <hi>Livie,</hi> for as they were pillaging of him in the high-waies far from any company, and where none could eſpy them. He ſaw a flight of Cranes in the air, to whom he cried aloud, O Cranes you ſhall be witneſses of what theſe men do now unto me. After his death it was a long time before any could be known or ſuſpected of the murther, till a time that there was a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn meeting in the Country, at which were theſe two mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers, where they heard a great company of Cranes make a noiſe in the ait; whereat one of them ſaid to his companion, in a jeering manner (not thinking any elſe had heard him) hark, hark, yonder are the witneſses of the death of <hi>Livie.</hi> But by chanee one that was by overheard them, and could not tell what it meant, but ſuſpected ſome evill, which made him advertiſe the Judge and the Governours what he had heard. To make ſhort, my two gallants were taken, and confeſſed the truth, and were executed according to juſtice proceeding from their too much talk without heed taking. For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ought to a man take heed what he would ſpeak before he let a word eſcape from him, and to conſider before whom and in what time and place to ſpeak. <hi>Hecates</hi> the Greek Orator was reprooved, for that being at a feaſt he ſpake never a word, which <hi>Archimides</hi> underſtanding anſwered for him. Do not you know, that thoſe which know when to ſpeak well, know as well when to be ſilent; I might alledge infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite examples in divers hiſtories, in ſeverall times, of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ignominies and death it ſelf, which hath happened to men by their too much babling. Therefore a man ought well to conſider before he opens his mouth, whether that which he
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:175728:14"/>intends to ſpeak, may not turn to his prejudice. The great <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> called the Cenſorian, was from his infancy, naturally ſlow of ſpeech, whereof being reprehended by many who conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he affected too much extream taciturnity, made them this anſwer, I am not diſpleaſed that I am reproved for hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my peace, ſeeing none hath occaſion to reprove me for my courſe of life; for then (and not before) I ſhal break ſilence, and ſhall then know to ſpeak what I cannot keep in. <hi>Iſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> in his book to <hi>Dominicus</hi> writes, that there are two times ſet for to ſpeak, one when the buſineſſe is neceſſary, the other when a man ſpeaks of what he knows. <hi>Plutarch</hi> compares him that ſpeaks of what he knows not, to an emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty veſſell, which ſounds more than one that is full. The Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher <hi>Zeno</hi> ſhews us that nature hath given us two ears, &amp; only one tongue for this cauſe, that we may hear much and ſpeak little. <hi>Horace</hi> counſels us to ſhun thoſe that ask many queſtions, becauſe they are occaſion of much babling. <hi>Sueto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> reports, and divers others confirm it, that the principall reaſon that moved <hi>Octavian</hi> ſo much to favour <hi>Mecenas</hi> was, becauſe of his Taciturnity and little ſpeech. <hi>Cicero</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that <hi>Cato</hi> the Oratour would never put any oration of his in writing, ſaying that if he ſhould ſpeak any thing he might repent of, he would not have his hand brought as a reproach againſt him, which he could not deny. And leſt in reprehending too much ſpeech I ſhould run into the ſame er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, I will hold my peace with the Philoſopher concluding, that I have repented me many times for ſpeaking, but never for holding my peace.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat I ſhall ſay of this will ſeem novelty to ſome, &amp; fabulous to others; becauſe it is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult thing to prove, neither do I intend to oblige my ſelf to make it good, nevertheleſs me thinks the authority of thoſe that have writ hereof is true or very likely, <hi>Plinie</hi> and <hi>Varro</hi> ſpeaking of the time of mans life, affirm, that the learned Egyptians knew by experience, that man according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of nature, could not live above a hundred years, and if any one happen to live longer, it is by ſome particular influence and force of the ſtars, and a thing marvellous in nature. Of this they took their ground from the heart of man, in which by an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notomy they have found experimentally marvellous ſecrets. For they ſay at the age of one year, the heart of man weighs two of their draghms, at the age of two year four, and ſo many years as he lives ſo many two draghms the heart en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſes, ſo that attaining to fifty years, the heart weighs a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred draghms. And from that time afterwards it diminiſheth its weight every year two draghms, as before it did increaſe. So that in a hundred years the heart annihilates it ſelf, and the body dies, if by ſome other accident it be not advanced ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, for there are ſo many accidental cauſes which may and commonly cauſe death, that there are few men arrive half the way to make this experience. If this thing ſeem ſtrange to ſome of us, yet the Egyptians hold it for certain according to divers Authors, and ſome, as <hi>Lewis Caelius,</hi> alledging <hi>Dieſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corides</hi> to have ſpoken much of this amongſt other notable things, as alſo <hi>Peter Crinit</hi> in his book of honeſt diſcipline, and <hi>Cornelius Agrippa.</hi> I ſcite all theſe Authors becauſe it is a thing hard to be believed. Let every one then give what
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:175728:15"/>credit to it, ſeems good to himſelf. And now we are treating of the heart of man, and of ſo many excellencies that are in it, we will not ſpeak of one alone, we muſt underſtand accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Ariſto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Alſo, this is the common opinion of all naturall Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, That the firſt part which is formed in man, is the heart, as the root of all the members in a humane body, fountain of all naturall heat, and the laſt member that dies in man, and looſes its motion. It is ſo noble and delicate a member, that it cannot be touched, but it is preſent death. <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi> recites an other wonder which happens ſome times, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that men have been fonnd to have the heart hairy, and he that hath it ſo is very valiant and ſtrong of diſpoſition, which was experimented in <hi>Ariſtomines,</hi> who killed with his own hand in battell three hundred Lacedemonians, who afterwards having eſcaped many dangers, by his great valour at laſt died, and being opened his heart was found hairy. <hi>Suetonus</hi> in the life of <hi>Caligula</hi> and <hi>Plinie,</hi> alſo ſaith, that if a man die of poiſon his heart cannot burn although you throw it in the fire; which was verified by the heart of <hi>Germanicus</hi> father of <hi>Caligula.</hi> So it fareth with them that die of the diſeaſe called the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ague, or griping at the heart. And we muſt know that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the pellicles of the heart, is the ſeat of laughter, and to this purpoſe the ancient Hiſtorians write, that the Roman-Gladiators, having by any blow the caul or pellicles of the heart ſtrook, died laughing. But even as laughter and joy proceeds from the heart, ſo melancholy proceeds from thence, and likewiſe good and evill thoughts. Speech is procreated there, and divers are of opinion that it is the principall ſeat and reſidence of the ſoul, which ſeems to be confirmed by Chriſt himſelf, when he ſays, that wicked and evill thoughts proceed from the heart. And that which enters in at the mouth ſoils not for thoſe are indifferent things.

               <argument>
                  <p>Of two Women; the one of which, in the habit of a man was made Pope, the other, Empreſſe.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Beleeve many have heard of a woman Pope: But becauſe, peradventure, all know not by what means, and that it was one of the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt things that could happen amongſt men, I will here ſpeak of it, as it is extracted out of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true Hiſtories. She was born in England, and in her youth grew acquainted with a learned man, of whom perceiving her ſelf to be beloved, and ſhe loved him no leſſe, took the habit of a man, and named her ſelf <hi>Iohn;</hi> and forſaking her Countrey, went along to dwell with him in the Town of Athens, where then flouriſhed the Schools with all manner of Learning, and there lived ſome time; where by her induſtry ſhe attained to ſo much Learning, that afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring her ſelf to Rome, ſhe read publickly in the Schools, in the habit of a Doctor: By which readings, and publick diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, ſhe ſo gained the opinion of the Auditors, that ſhe was reputed one of the moſt Learnedſt men of all her time; and obtained ſuch favour and authority among all, that in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancie of the Apoſtolick Chair, by the death of <hi>Leo</hi> the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of that name, in the year of our Lord Eight hundred fifty two, being taken for a man, ſhe was choſen Great Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome, and Univerſal Pope in the Church of God; and kept that Chair two years and thirty odde days. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this eſtate, (as happens always to ſuch ill enterpriſes) not having care of the preſervation of her Chaſtitie, had the company of one of her Favourite <hi>Serviteurs,</hi> in whom ſhe truſted moſt, in ſo much, that Madam the Pope proved with Child. Nevertheleſs, ſhe hid her great belly with ſuch care,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:175728:16"/>that none but her Minion could know any thing of it. Howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, God would not ſuffer ſuch wickedneſs to laſt long, nor go unpuniſhed; for as ſhe went along, according to the common ſolemnity, to viſit Saint <hi>Iean de Lateran,</hi> her time of bearing being come, ſhe had publick correction for her ſecret ſin; for comming near to a certain place which is between the Church of Saint <hi>Clement,</hi> and the Theatre (improperly called <hi>Colli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus,</hi>) ſhe was delivered (with great pain) of a humane creature, which died incontinently with the Mother, ſo both of them together (without any Pomp, or mourning) were put into the ground and buried: And for that cauſe, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion is, that all the Soveraign Biſhops that have been ever ſince, come ſhort of that place; and when they come near it, turn down another ſtreet, in deteſtation of ſo horrible an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. And when they chooſe a Pope, they ſet him upon a thing like a Cloſe-ſtool, pierced through, that they may ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know, whether him that the chooſe be a male. Many Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors write of this, but I find not one that aſſures it: <hi>Platinus</hi> onely writes of the Election of Popes ever ſince, as is before recited. Of all the Authors, there is <hi>Martin</hi> and <hi>Platin</hi> in the <hi>Life of Popes</hi> and <hi>Sabollicus</hi> and St. <hi>Anthony</hi> in their Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that write of it. I find written more, that in that ſtreet, upon the ground, there is an Image of ſtone, that repreſents the Birth of a Child, and the Death of that impudent and bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen faced woman. Whence we muſt know, (though that did come to paſs as is before recited,) during the time this woman held the world in abuſe, the Church was not maimed in Faith; becauſe in it could not be wanting the Head, Chriſt, from whom proceeds the influence of all Grace, and the utmoſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the Sacraments, by means of which Head, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have not been wanting to them that received them ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily, and by a lively faith; for Chriſt ſupplied this want in them by his Grace. And put the caſe that this woman, nor no other could be capable to receive or give any one onely Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Orders, nor abſolve any perſon, and that therefore they that have been made Miniſters by her hands, muſt be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained a new: yet it is ſo, that Chriſt ſupplying that default
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:175728:16"/>in them by his grace, as we have ſaid, there is no further need to do it over again; the truth is, ſhe was for her wiſedome to be admired in that ſhe could for ſo many years, cover her eſtate, and live after that cloſe manner.</p>
               <p>But that which made <hi>Theodoſia,</hi> Empreſs of <hi>Constanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> is not leſſe to be admired; becauſe the wit the one uſed to counterfeit her ſelf a man, the other uſed to make known to all that ſhe was a woman; for in the vacancy of the Empire by the death of her brother <hi>Zoe,</hi> and of her husband <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> then made a Monk, ſhe knew ſo well how to behave her ſelf in the carrying through of affairs, ſhe became Empreſs, and for the ſame was feared and obeyed. For without the help either of father, or brother, or husband, ſhe governed the Empire excellently in peace and proſperity, for the ſpace of two years, and no more, becauſe ſhe lived no longer; and died to the grief of all her ſubjects in the time of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the ninth, in the year of grace, one thouſand and fifty.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He contemplative matters, concerning the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of man are infinite. <hi>Lactantius Firmian</hi> writes a book of them apart. And ſo have other learned men. In truth there is one thing amongſt many others that deſerves particular conſideration to be known, that is, why God hath made all other creatures (except man, who is born the chief) whoſe eyes for the moſt part look downwards towards the earth, and not onely reaſonable creatures, but alſo vegitables, as we ſee of Trees who have their head and foundation in the earth, and their boughs and branches above; as for man, he hath created him onely with his eys towards heaven, his
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:175728:17"/>face upwards, and his body ſtreight up. And although by all reaſon, for theſe things it were ſufficient to alledge the will of God, yet it ſeems this was done by a Myſtery, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore worthy of contemplation; ſo in truth our diſpoſing or making, manifeſtly ſhews us, that we were not born for the earth, but we were created to contemplate high and heavenly things, which are not communicated to other creatures, not being capable of them, and there is none but man onely that is worthy of them; God hath created all beaſts with their head downward, to ſhew that man onely reigns over them. One of theſe reaſons is eloquently noted by <hi>Lactantius,</hi> ſaying, that God having determined to make man for heaven, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures for earth, he made man ſtreight and upright and diſpoſed to heavenly contemplation, that he might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the effects, and have in reverence the place of his origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and his native Country, making all other creatures low and bowing towards the earth; becauſe they have no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation in heaven. <hi>Aristotle</hi> that had no light of faith ſaith, That man onely amongſt all creatures goes up-right, in reſpect that his ſubſtance, and his parts are Celeſtiall and not Terreſtial. And the Office of the ſpirits is knowledge and underſtanding, in which man could not well know how to exerciſe, if his body were great and weighty; becauſe the charge of his body would make his underſtanding dull.</p>
               <p>Learned St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> who forgot not to diſcuſs, and to examine any thing, leaves not this queſtion undetermined, for in the expoſition of youth and age he ſaith, that for two cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes man was formed upright towards heaven, The one that he might be the moſt perfect of all creatures, and he which participates and comes neareſt to the quality of heaven. The other becauſe in the proportion of his body, he is more hot then any other creature, and that the nature of heat is to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance upward; other creatures keep the mean as leſs participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the heavenly quality, and having leſſe of this heat which raiſeth up. For this cauſe they are not of the ſame work and diſpoſition as man. It ſeems in this St. <hi>Thomas</hi> would follow the opinion of the Platoniſts, maintaining that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:175728:17"/>the heat and the ſpirit of man (in which be abounds more than any other creature, conſidering the proportion of his body) is the cauſe that man goeth upright and ſtreight as he doth; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by the force and vigour of the ſpirits &amp; the bloud, he lifts himſelf upright, being helped by the compoſition and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Elements, whereof man is compoſed, with ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality &amp; weight, that he may lift up himſelf. Now ſomething is in it ſeeing that by that part of the ſoul, &amp; this of the body men are put forward to the love and contemplation of heaven, they ought then to conſider and think of high, ſpirituall and good things, and on the contrary to deſpiſe and ſhun low, baſe, and earthly things. And yet nevertheleſſe, we leave our ſelves ſo to be overcome with the cares of this life, and earthly conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, that moſt of our time we lift up our eys to heaven, but our ſpirits and thoughts are on the earth.</p>
               <p>As for the propriety of the ſpirit of man, whereof we have ſpoken, <hi>Plinie</hi> alledges one thing more, which though it be not of ſuch importance as the reſt, yet it may give a taſt of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to him that knows it not, or would not have thought ſo much, though experience manifeſts it daily. He ſaith, that a man when he is dead, weigheth more than when he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, and that it is ſo in all kind of creatures, and that he that hath eaten his break-faſt weighs leſſe than when he was faſting. <hi>Eraſmus</hi> in one of his Problemes ſaith as much, and other things of note, giving the ſame reaſons that <hi>Plinie</hi> doth, which are founded in the eſſence of theſpirits and the air which doth lighten them as we ſaid before. So likewiſe a man that is faſting weighs more than a man that hath eaten ſomething, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though one would think he ſhould weigh leſs; foraſmuch as he that hath eaten a meal, hath ſo much the greater charge and weight. And nevertheleſſe it is ſo, and we need not marvel at it, for eating and drinking augments the ſpirits and chears him, which makes him grow and increaſe in natural heat. From hence it comes, that when one man aſſays to lift up another; if he wil that is lifted up, he can make himſelf heavier by forcing forth his breath with in him, which if he ſhould keep in he would weigh lighter, alſo one that runs breaths but little that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:175728:18"/>he may run the more ſwift; becauſe the air being a very light E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement, deſires to lift it ſelf up high, where its place is naturally: as we ſee, a piece of skin of chejucel, or a bladder, unblown thrown into the water, it ſinks preſently; but blow it up with air and it ſwims above the water. In the ſame place <hi>Plinie</hi> ſaith, That a body dead in the water, when it comes to float, if it be a man his face will be upwards towards heaven, if it be a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſhe wil riſe with her face downwards, which provident nature hath ſo ordeined, to cover the ſhamefull parts of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. There is yet an other natural reaſon for it. And that is, that women weigh heavier in the foreparts becauſe of their breaſts. And men in their back-parts becauſe of their ſhoulders.</p>

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:175728:18"/>
                  <hi>Milo</hi> travelling over a Mountain, and withdrawing himſelf out of the common rode for refreſhment, ſaw amongſt other Trees, an Oak having two great branches, which ſome had begun to cleave by great force with wedges, and left them behind, not able to perform it, which he being very deſirous to accompliſh, put both his hands into the cleft, and drew till he had opened them a little more, ſo that the wedges fell to the ground: but whether becauſe (it may be) his ſtrength failed him, or that (it may be) he thought the branches were not of ſo great force, he let go a little, whereby the Tree cloſed on ſuch a ſudden, that both his hands were faſt taken therein, ſo that he could not eſcape out, and none paſſing by to help him, he died there in great pain, and of famine, one of the moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable and unhappieſt deaths that could be imagined; for he was made a prey to the moſt ſalvage beaſts, and ſo his own ſtrength killed him. If the death of <hi>Milo</hi> was ſo ſtrange, this of <hi>Echilus</hi> the Poet is no leſs ſtrange; for he one day walking out of a Town in Sicilie, where he dwelt, to take a little warmth of the Sun, becauſe it was then cold weather, and he being old and bald-hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, whoſe head ſhone again with whiteneſs, ſeated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a high place where the Sun beat, and having his head bare, an Eagle by chance flew over him in the Air, having in his tallons a Tortoiſe, and ſeeing the white head of <hi>Echilus,</hi> took it for a ſtone, and ſo let it fall a great heighth thereupon, ſo to break it, that afterwards he might get the fleſh of the Tortoiſe to eat it; which broke his skull, whereof he died pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently. A wonderfull thing, ſeeing that he ſate ſo high, in an open place, where one would have thought it impoſſible for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing to fall upon his head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baptiſta Fulgoſa,</hi> in a near book that he hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of Examples, recites the unfortunatee death of a King of Navarre, named CHARLES: this King was old, and very ill, and troubled with a great pain in all his Nerves; for which pain, by the counſel of all the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Phyſitians, there could be found no Remedie but one,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:175728:19"/>which was to wrap him in a linnen cloath ſteeped in <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitae,</hi> and ſow him in it round on every ſide, and he which ſowed him in, having nothing by him to cut off the thread, took a candle lighted that was next him, the flame whereof took hold of the <hi>Aqua-vitae</hi> ſo ſuddenly, that before the King could be unſowed again, or have any help he was burned in the flame, and ſo he was cured of the pain he had in his Nerves, and likewiſe of all his other diſeaſes. The death of <hi>Philemon</hi> was very pleaſant, for ſeeing an Aſſe come near to a table where on there was figs, and fell to eating them, fell into ſo great a laughter that the end of his laugh accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the end of his life. And it is reported that <hi>Philiſton</hi> the Commique Poet died laughing. And ſo we find ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men that have died of joy, of which number was <hi>Dennis</hi> the Tyrant of Cicilie, <hi>Diagoras,</hi> and that Roman Dame, who ſeeing her ſon return home, who was thought to be ſlain in the battell, died preſently. That death of the Shepheard <hi>Cratis,</hi> whether it be ſo or no, is likewiſe very ſtrange, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſleep on a Mountain amongſt his Goats, a Buck-Goat killed him, for jealouſie he had of one of the She-Goats, with whom <hi>Cratis</hi> abhominably perverted the order of nature. <hi>Lewis Celius</hi> and <hi>Volateran</hi> recites this ſtory, alledging for it ſome Greek authors. I leave divers other ſorts of deaths as that of Pope <hi>Bonniface,</hi> who died mad being famiſhed in priſon. Of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond of England. Of the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Magunce,</hi> who was killed and eaten up by a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Rats. Of <hi>Decius</hi> the Emperour, of whom <hi>Familius Victor</hi> writes, that though victorious, he was found dead ſwimming in a Lake. In this ſort in our time died <hi>Lewis</hi> King of Hungary. And <hi>Sforza</hi> (father to that gallant Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Duke <hi>Francis Sforza</hi>) drowned himſelf thinking to ſave one of his Pages. <hi>Andrew</hi> King of Provance died by the hand of his wife, aſſiſted by ſome other women who ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled him and hanged him up. The Emperor <hi>Tiberius</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo poiſoned by his wife <hi>Agripina.</hi> So Kings, Princes, and great Lords, are ſubject to unfortunate and unhappy deaths as well as poor men, although ſomtimes they are adviſed thereof yet in vain.</p>

                  <p>How many Popes hath been ſince Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and how the Popes came to change their names, alſo by whom they uſed to have been choſen.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ne of the moſt excellent hiſtories, and that Chriſtians ought well to know, is the lives of the Soveraign Biſhops, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and Vicars of Jeſus Chriſt. Theſe are thoſe which have been Biſhops of Rome ſince the firſt Vicar of God, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the chair there, the Mark for his Succeſſours, in which place it hath always been even to this day. And put the caſe that ſometimes ſome of the Soveraign Biſhops have been abſent from that Chair and the Town, yet Rome ceaſed not to be the Biſhoprick, and principall ſeat of the abſent Biſhop, for St. <hi>Peter</hi> placed it there firſt of all where it hath been ever ſince. But to return to our purpoſe, there hath been in Rome two hundred twenty and one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, or univerſal Popes, as I can gather even to this day, in which <hi>Iulius</hi> the third governed; amongſt which there hath been many Martyrs, moſt excellent Saints and learned Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours; yet nevertheleſſe it is not without great admiration, and a conſicieration of great myſterie, that none of them go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned ſo long time as St. <hi>Peter</hi> did there. For it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God, as he excelled all the reſt in ſanctity, ſo in the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that dignity, he paſſed them all, for he lived in it five and twenty years after the death of our Saviour Chriſt, the firſt leven whereof he lived at Antioch, and the other eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen at Rome, where he placed the Chair. And ſome are of opinion that none of his ſucceſſours, for the time to come, ſhall attain to that he did, no more than thoſe that are paſt already.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:175728:20"/>There is alſo another thing that I take notice of in reading the lives of the Popes, that is, that ſince Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to this very time I find not one that in changing of his name, hath called himſelf <hi>Peter,</hi> nor that had that name before his change. So that it ſeems, that God would put that name <hi>Peter</hi> for a foundation in the Church, and no where elſe.</p>
               <p>The ſaying of the Tranſlatour.
<q>I know not in what place the Authour hath taken out this laſt opinion, for there is to be found ſeven (at the least) which before were named <hi>Peter.</hi> As <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> the fifth, <hi>John</hi> the two and twentieth, <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine</hi> the fitfh, <hi>Clement</hi> the fixt, <hi>Gregory</hi> the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levench, <hi>Boriniface</hi> the ninth, And <hi>Alexander</hi> the fifth, leaving out one Anti-pope.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Yet it it is good to know from whence came the firſt chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their name. Know that Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the fourth being dead in the year eight hundred forty two, they choſe for the Soveraign Biſhop of Rome, a Roman, of Noble Bloud, il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious, and of good breeding, who was called <hi>Hoge-face;</hi> and becauſe this name ſeemed to him dirty, and ill agreeing with ſuch a dignity, and remembring that our Saviour chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the name of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> would alſo change his, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med himſelf <hi>Sergius,</hi> which was his fathers name. From thence came the cuſtome obſerved to this day, that he which is choſen Pope, may tak eat his pleaſure what name pleaſeth him beſt: And although they have changed their names, they keep ſtill this cuſtome, to take the name of ſome of their predeceſſors. Of theſe things, are the Authors, <hi>Platinus, Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew Palmer, Euſebins</hi> and others, now we muſt underſtand according to what is found in hiſtories, that even to the time of <hi>Constantine</hi> the great, (which gave ſo much Goods and Priviledges to the Church of Rome) becauſe the Soveraign Biſhops had been all Martyred, there was no canvaſing or ſuite who ſhould have it, for none deſired it, but contrary,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:175728:20"/>either by force or requeſt, they were conſtrained to accept the charge, and ſo even till that time they were choſen to that dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, onely by the Prieſts which were in the Roman Church.</p>
               <p>But ſince the Emperours were Chriſtians, and likewiſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Citizens of Rome, they were choſen by the Clergy, with the voice and conſent of the people. That done, they ſent to the Emperour, which then kept at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to deſire a confirmation; and it ſeems this was to pleaſe them, or becauſe they would have it ſo. Sometimes this confirmation was done by the Governour which they had at Rome, called <hi>Hyparcus,</hi> who had the authority of the Emperour, now was this confirmation by the Emperour or the Soveraign Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ſure and firm, but whether for the Tyranny and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Church, that after the death of <hi>Benet</hi> the firſt, <hi>Pelagius</hi> the ſecond was choſen. But becauſe at that time Rome was beſieged by the Lombards, from whence are deſcended the Lombards, and alſo that there fell ſuch an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of rain, that the Rivers were all overflown, in ſuch ſort, that (as <hi>Platinus</hi> ſaith) there was an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of perſons drowned and periſhed, ſo that it was thought for certain it was a generall Deluge. This <hi>Pelagius</hi> was the firſt that governed the Biſhoprick without making the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour acquainted; yet nevertheleſs he feared that <hi>Maurice</hi> the Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> would be angry at it, therefore ſent his Embaſſadors to excuſe it, and gave the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons we have before recited. Afterwards, ſome years having paſt that this cuſtome was continued without diſcontinuance, and <hi>Benet</hi> the ſecond coming to be created Soveraign Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the fourth of that name, being advertized of his ſingular holineſſe and great learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, had reſpect of his authority, and ſent this Pope a Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or letter Patent, by which he renounced for himſelf and his ſucceſſours, upon all reaſons or pretences whatſoever, the confirmation of the Papall election, that from thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſo ſoon as the Clergy or the people of Rome, ſhould have choſen a Soveraign Biſhop, he ſhould be held for the Vicar of God, without other confirmation or amplification.</p>

               <p>This was obſerved for ſome time: but afterwards, the Church of Rome comming to be afflicted, and its inheritance to be moleſted by the Lombards, that reigned in that Country; and being ſeconded by <hi>Charls Martel,</hi> in the time of <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the third; and by <hi>Pepin</hi> his ſon, in the time of <hi>Stephen</hi> the ſecond; and at ſome other times, having ſome little help from the Emperours of Conſtantinople.

By means whereof, we may know, that either by ſpecial Priviledge, or by Uſurpation of the Succeſſors of <hi>Charlemain</hi> to the Empire, they began to ſet up again the confirmation of the Pope, confirming him by the Emperours, and approving the Election that is made of the Soveraign Biſhops, who acknowledged them for Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, having recourſe to them in their neceſſities and affairs, Afterwards by ſucceſſion of time, and in the year Eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſeventeen, <hi>Paſquel</hi> the firſt was choſen by the death of <hi>Stephen</hi> the fourth, and obeyed, without waiting for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Emperour <hi>Lowes,</hi> ſon to <hi>Charls</hi> the great; wherefore he ſent his Ambaſsadours to excuſe it, and ſay, that he was conſtrained by the people not to ſtay for his confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; the Emperor <hi>Lewes</hi> accepted this excuſe, and neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſent them word, that he would that the ancient cuſtomes ſhould be retained and kept. A long time after, during which the malice of men increaſed, there were divers ſcandals and diſorders found in the Elections, which to remedie, Pope <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi> the ſecond of that name, in the year One thouſand ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty nine, being in publick Councel, made a Decree, which begins, <hi>In nomini Domini,</hi> in the three and twentieth diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, by which he gives the authority of choiſe onely to Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Prieſts and Cardinals; following which Ordinance, even to this day, is made a worthy and Canonical Election, without ſeeking or waiting for the Imperial confirmation: for this Priviledge proceeds not ſo much from reaſon, as from the

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is one marvelous thing, and that which draws men into a deep contemplation of the works of God, the great diverſity of Fiſhes in the Sea, and likewiſe of the Beaſts of the Earth: <hi>Plinie Albertus Magnus, Ariſtotle,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other Philoſophers treat much of them. I know very well, that a reaſonable man is found no where, but upon the earth, and men inhabit not in the water; Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I have read, there are fiſhes in the ſea that have the ſhape of a man, amongſt which there are male and female; and the female hath the very form of a woman, and are called <hi>Nerei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,</hi> and the male <hi>Tritons;</hi> whereof I will not recite many things, in reckoning up a great number of men of light and ſmall authority, which I have heard report to this purpoſe things ſtrange and variable: Yet nevertheleſs, I will ſay that which hath been written by men of authority, grave, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of credit. Amongſt the which <hi>Plenie</hi> ſaith, That in the time of the Emperour <hi>Tiberius,</hi> the inhabitants of Lisbon, a Town in Portugal, (then famous, and is yet,) ſent Ambaſsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to the Emperour, to certifie him, that they had ſeen one of theſe Tritons retire and hide himſelf, ſometimes in a Cave near the Sea, and that there he made Muſick with the ſhell of a fiſh; and ſayes yet further, that <hi>Octavius Auguſtus</hi> was certified, that they had ſeen upon the coaſt of France, divers <hi>Nereides</hi> or <hi>Mer-maids,</hi> but indeed they were dead upon the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:175728:22"/>ſea-ſhote.

All this is wonderfull, and yet who would not believe ſuch men, being ſeconded with what I ſhall yet ſay. <hi>Alexander</hi> of Alexandria, ſaies, that he was advertized for a certain truth that in <hi>Epire,</hi> there is a fountain near the Sea to which children went often to fetch water, and that near to that place came out a Triton, and hid himſelf in a Cave, and there kept himſelf cloſe, till he ſaw a young maid alone, whom he would take away and carry with him into the ſea, which he had
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:175728:22"/>done oftentimes, whereof the inhabitants being advertiſed, ſet ambuſhes for him, ſo that he was taken, and brought before the Juſtice of the place, where he was found in all his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers agreeable to a man, wherefore they aſſayed to keep him and gave him meat to eat but he would not touch a bit of any thing that was offered him, and ſo he died as well of famine, as that he was too many daies in an Element that was ſtrange to him, and altogether contrary to his own proper nature. This Hiſtory is alſo recounted by <hi>Peter Gellie</hi> a Modern Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour in his book, that he hath written of beaſts, and ſaies, that while he lived at <hi>Marſellus,</hi> heard an old Fiſher-man report, that his father had told him for truth, that he had ſeen a <hi>Tryton</hi> or Mer-man ſuch a one as we have ſpoken of, which was preſented to King <hi>Renus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A thing therefore ſo approved, and by ſo many Authors, and that all the world holds for a certain, ought not to be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a lie, but held for a truth.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough every one takes pleaſure to ſpeak of the ages of the world, and of things that have hapned in the one, and what hath been ſeen in the other, yet there are many that know not how this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion is made, nor how many years is given to every of them. The Age of the life of the world even unto this day, is divided by the greateſt part of Authors, in ſix parts or Ages, Though ſome would perſwade us there are ſeven, which is the diviſion which the Hebrews make: But as for me I will follow the opinion of <hi>Euſebius,</hi> and the common opinion of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:175728:23"/>all the Hiſtorians, that name but ſix. Afterwards upon the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of theſe ages, there is yet ſo great confuſion and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence amongſt them, that none can reſolvedly aſſure himſelf. It ſeems principally the Authors divided itinto two parts. The one whereof follows the computation of the ſeventy two interpreters, that Tranſlated the old Teſtament out of the Hebrew tongue into Greek; The others follow the Hebrew and common text of the Bible. Of all which I will recite their opinions.</p>
               <p>The firſt Age of the World is reckoned, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God created it to the univerſall Deluge, which was the infancy of the World, which Age laſted a long time. And it is to be believed, that during that time, there happened a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men many things of note, although we have neither hiſtory nor any memory thereof. But that which the holy Scripture ſaith, That after God had created <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and before them all other things, and that he had given him Soveraignty over all Creatures of the earth, and fiſhes in the Sea. <hi>Adam</hi> begat two children, <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> which brought forth to the world many other children, whereof grew a great people. <hi>Moſes</hi> writes afterwards, that <hi>Cain</hi> built a Town in the Eaſt, which he called <hi>Hen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>c,</hi> according to his ſons name. In this time <hi>Lainech</hi> having buried his wife <hi>Biga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> was the firſt that ever had two wives, of one of which he had a Son, named <hi>Tubal,</hi> which invented Muſick of voices, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ols and Organs, and wind inſtruments. <hi>Caein</hi> invented the Art of forging Iron and Iron works, and engraving during this time the people were, as divers Authors write, of a marvellous greatneſſe, and ſtrength, and ſpitefull, and puiſſant beyond humane power. And finally, for the ſin of man came a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Deluge over all the earth, by the which all humane li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage was deſtroyed (except <hi>Noah</hi>) and thoſe that were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved with him in the Ark.</p>
               <p>And this Age laſted according to the Hebrews 1656 years, to which agrees <hi>Filo, Beda,</hi> and St. <hi>Ierom,</hi> and the common text of the Bible. According to the ſeventy two inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, <hi>Euſebius,</hi> and other Hiſtorians, it laſted 2242 years.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:175728:23"/>St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, 2272. And <hi>Alfonſus</hi> King of Spain, 2882 years.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Age began in <hi>Noah,</hi> after he was come out of the Ark; and laſted to the birth of <hi>Abraham;</hi> which laſted, according to the interpreters, <hi>Euſebius, Iſoaorus,</hi> and the greateſt part of the Chronicles, 942 years. But the Hebrews ſay much leſſe, and make it but 292 years, of the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion are <hi>Filo,</hi> and <hi>Ioſephus.</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> makes it 1072 years.</p>
               <p>We have likewiſe remaining very little of certainty of things happening in theſe times, neither is there any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar hiſtory to be found of them, but onely of ſome things in generall, touching the beginning of Kingdomes, and inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Provinces.</p>

                  <hi>Noah</hi> came out of the Ark and planted vines, and what happened to him, every one knows; he begat children, and they alſo begat more, in ſuch ſort, that the world began to be peopled. <hi>Cam</hi> the ſecond ſon of <hi>Noah,</hi> begat <hi>Chus,</hi> from whence deſcended the Ethiopians; he alſo begat <hi>Miſraim,</hi> from whom came the Egyptians; and <hi>Canaan,</hi> from whence came the Canaanites. The other ſon named <hi>Iaphet,</hi> begat <hi>Gomer</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> from whome are deſcended other people, too long to recite. In this time the Tower of <hi>Babel</hi> was built; and ſo came the confuſion of languages, by means whereof hapned (accord<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Ioſephus</hi> in his ſecond book of Antiquities) that men ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated themſelves into divers Provinces, and Iſles to live there.</p>
               <p>During this Age, <hi>Tubal,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Iaphet,</hi> came to inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit <hi>Spain,</hi> which he erected into a Kingdome, and there began to reign, ſome ſay he was called <hi>Subal</hi> or <hi>Tubal,</hi> ſon of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth,</hi> Nephew to <hi>Eber.</hi> The reign of the Scythians began al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in this time in the North parts, and have alwaies pretended their reign to precede all others for antiquity, as <hi>Trogius, Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peius,</hi> and <hi>Iuſtin</hi> recites; ſo that betwixt them and the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, for this, grew a great controverſie. In this time was found out by <hi>Cam,</hi> the Magick-Art and Incantations, who was alſo named <hi>Zorcastes.</hi> Towards the end of this age, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:175728:24"/>a little before the birth of Abraham, (according to <hi>Euſebius</hi> and <hi>Beda</hi>) the moſt puiſſant reign of the Aſſyrians began to raiſe it ſelf, having for their firſt King, <hi>Belus,</hi> which ſome ſay to be <hi>Iupiter.</hi> And the ſecond <hi>Ninus,</hi> in whoſe time <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was born, the which <hi>Ninus</hi> conquered a great number of Towns and Provinces. There was yet in Egypt an other kind of Kingdome named Danaſtia, whoſe firſt King was called <hi>Veyor</hi> or <hi>Vezor</hi> (according to <hi>Euſebius</hi>) who like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe towards the end of this age ſetled the reign of the Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, in Peleponenſis, now called Moors, whereof <hi>Ageſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> was the firſt King. In this very time began Idolatry and Gentiliſm. And this is all that we can confuſedly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of this ſecond Age, in the end whereof, the renowned City of Nineve was built of an admirable greatneſſe, for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to hiſtories it was three daies journy in circuit.</p>
               <p>Preſently after began the third Age,
<label type="milestone">

In the beginning whereof <hi>Semyramis</hi> wife of <hi>Ninus,</hi> began her memorable acts, who feigned her ſelf to be young <hi>Ninus</hi> her ſon, and having chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her feminine habit reigned a long time, and conquered by arms many Provinces. She re-edified and compaſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with Walls the famous City of Babylon, in this very time was the Peregrination of <hi>Abraham</hi> by the commandement of God: and the victory which he had over four Kings to ſave <hi>Lot</hi> whom they led away priſoner. In this time we place the beginning of the Amazonians, &amp; likewiſe in Egypt flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Kings called <hi>Pharoes.</hi> Alſo <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> was deſtroyed in theſe dayes. In the time of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> began the Reign of the Argives in Theſſaly. And in the time of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> began to raign the Kings of Ceſtus, the firſt whereof was named <hi>Acre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A little after, <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was ſold into Egypt, as the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory recites. And likewiſe how his Father and his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:175728:24"/>Iſrael which were deſcended of them, lived four hundred and thirty years (according to <hi>Beda</hi>) and St. <hi>Augustine</hi> in his Book of the City of God. During this time, <hi>Hercules</hi> of Lybia went into Spain, where he raigned, &amp; after him, <hi>Iuer, Brigius, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga, Beto, Gerien,</hi> and others, whereof <hi>Beroſus,</hi> and others make mention, in this time the City of Scivil was built, which will give place to none in the world for Antiquity, as we may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of <hi>Beroſus</hi> and others. It was firſt named Ispalis of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pale,</hi> the ſon or Nephew of <hi>Hercules,</hi> which reigned in it, and whom as it is ſaid founded it. Although <hi>Iſiodorus</hi> ſaies it was named Iſpalis, becauſe it was built in a Moriſh place, and they were fain to ſtrike it ful of piles: but be it how it wil ſince it hath been called Spain, as <hi>Trogius, Pompeius, Iuſtin,</hi> and other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors do certifie. It is true that <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> ſince named it Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and greatly enobled it, and made it a Collonie, and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans dwelt in it, nevertheles, it was greatly enobled before. But to return to our firſt purpoſe, in ſucceſſion of time <hi>Moſes</hi> was born, under whoſe conduct the Hebrews came out of Egypt. In this time alſo was <hi>Iob</hi> the juſt. Then afterwards came the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge of Theſſalie, and many Kingdomes began to encreaſe in divers Provinces. In Ethiopia firſt reigned <hi>Ethiop;</hi> In Sicily, <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus;</hi> In Boecia, <hi>Boecim,</hi> And ſo the Countries received their names of their Princes. Then flouriſhed the Town of Troy, &amp; <hi>Iaeſon</hi> made a conqueſt of the Golden Fleece, from whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the hiſtory of <hi>Medea.</hi> The Amazons were then in their force. And the beginning of the raign of the Latines in Italy. In this very age <hi>Paris</hi> raviſhed <hi>Helena,</hi> which was the cauſe of the war &amp; deſtruction of Troy, &amp; of the coming of <hi>Aeneas</hi> into I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly, &amp; of divers other things which wil not admit of brevity.</p>
               <p>Then failed the third Age, which gave way to the fourth. And began at the raign of <hi>David</hi> the 2 K. of the Hebrews, which fourth age dured even to the Tranſmigration and Perigrinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Jews in Babylon, and laſted four hundred four-ſcore &amp; five years. <hi>Beda</hi> ſaith 474 years. This age may be called the youth of the world, during which happened an infinite many things, whereof hiſtories are full, in it was the original of the victories of good King <hi>David,</hi> he conquered the Philiſtines,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:175728:25"/>he avenged himſelf of the Amonites, for the injury which they did to his Ambaſtadours, and killed the Captain of the Aſſyrians. After him ſucceeded in the Kingdom the wiſe King <hi>Solomon,</hi> who built the rich Temple in Jeruſalem, he dead, the Kingdome was divided, <hi>Jeroboam</hi> ſucceeded to ten families, and <hi>Roboam</hi> his ſon to two.</p>
               <p>After the Empire of the Aſſyrians, which had laſted more than twelve hundred years, it was ruined by the death of <hi>Sardanaepalus,</hi> who was Lord thereof, and the moſt puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant King in the world, who was killed by <hi>Arbact.</hi> And then the Empire fell to the Medes. In ths very Age began the reigns of the moſt puiſſant Kings of Macedoma. And the Greeks began to count their years by Olimpiades, which were feaſts that they made from five years to five years, with certain prizes for them that deſerved beſt. Alſo was that puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant City of <hi>Carthage</hi> built by <hi>Dido.</hi> And a little while after Rome by <hi>Romulus</hi> and his brother <hi>Remus</hi> where the Kings began to reign. The great Town of Bizance was alſo built in this time, which is ſince called <hi>Constantinople</hi> Again there hapned great wars, and mutation of Signiories in many parts of the world, whereof hiſtories are full. And principally, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of this age, <hi>Nabucadonozor,</hi> King of the Medes and of Babylon, fell upon Jeruſalem, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed and the Temple alſo. Then led the people of Judea priſoners along with them: and from that it is called the Tranſmigration in Babylon.</p>
               <p>At which began the fifth Age of the world,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Age. </seg>5</label> which laſted even to the birth of Jeſus Chriſt, God and Man, our Saviour and Redeemer. And this ſhall laſt five hundred eighty nine years, by the computation of all.</p>
               <p>During this time, there was puiſſant Kings, and great Republicks in the world, ſuch as it is marvellous to read, and contemplate of the great things that happened in this Age; The Changes; The ruine of Eſtates; The ordering of great Armies: In brief, it is better to be ſilent than to abreviate them. Almoſt at the beginning of this Age began the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy of the Perſians, whoſe Kingdomes were then the greateſt,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:175728:25"/>by means of the victories of that great <hi>Cyrus,</hi> which reigned thirty years, during which time he conquered and diſcomfited the rich King <hi>Creſus</hi> of Lydia. Then was diſcomfited himſelf, and put to death by <hi>Tomoris</hi> Queen of the Scythians.</p>
               <p>Seventy years of this Age being accompliſhed. The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews came out of their Captivity. And the Temple that had been deſtroyed was re-edified by <hi>Solomon</hi> at Jeruſalem.</p>
               <p>In Europe the Romans chaſed their Kings and were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by Conſuls of which <hi>L. I. Brut,</hi> was the firſt, and the L. <hi>Collatine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Greece flouriſhed Arms, and letters, which brought forth many excellent Philoſophers and Captains.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Xerxes</hi> came thither with an innumerable army, but he was conſtrained to retire with great loſſe and diſgrace.</p>
               <p>Then came to flouriſh in Macedonia King <hi>Philip,</hi> who ſubdued all Greece, the Mother of learning and of arms, and which in this time brought forth <hi>Demosthenes, Thomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocles, Epaminondas, Agifilaus, Teno, Plato, Aristotle,</hi> and others the like. After the death of <hi>Philip,</hi> his ſon <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> went out of Greece, and entred Aſia, which he conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, deſtroying the Empire of Perſia. And by the Victories which he gained againſt King <hi>Darius,</hi> he lived the remainer of his life Monarch of all the world. But he dead, the Captains divided among themſelves, the Signiories and Lordſhips; which being ſo mingled bred a diſcord, which raiſed wars through all Aſia, and a great part of Europe.</p>
               <p>In like manner the power of the Romans and Carthage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians encreaſed beyond meaſure; for all of them ſtrove to command the whole world, and to attribute to themſelves the Empire. Theſe two forces fought divers times againſt one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo that each of theſe two Towns, brought forth Captains excellent skilfull in arms. Carthage, put forward <hi>Asdrubal, Hano, Hanibal.</hi> Rome, <hi>Fabius, Scipio, Marcellus, Emil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> and others. Finally, after a great quantity of bloudſhed, Rome became victorious, and Carthage deſolate, deſtroyed, and all Affrica tributary. This Victory obteined, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, proud, and envious of the Greeks proſperity, found out
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:175728:26"/>an occaſion of war with them, in which Greece was taken and made Tributary.</p>
               <p>Not contented with this. Their covetouſneſſe made them paſſe into Aſia, where they overcame <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and then <hi>Mithridates,</hi> making themſelves Lords of Aſia the leſſe, as alſo of Syria, and Paleſtina, and Egypt, and all the coaſt on this ſide of France, Spain, England, and the greateſt part of Germany. Of all which Conqueſts, the chief Miniſters were, <hi>Sylla, Marius, Lucullus, Pompeius, Caeſar,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: it happened that their envious ambition, ſwelled their hearts, whereof bred civill wars amongſt them, that every one would be a Commander one over another: but at the laſt, the Empire fell to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> whom after many fortunes had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened unto him, his Nephew, or adopted ſon <hi>Octavian</hi> ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, who after having overcome all his enemies, he reſted peaceably in ſuch ſort, that ſeeing himſelf in peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with all the Kings and Common-wealths in the world, he made them lock up the doors of his God <hi>Janus,</hi> which were never ſhut in time of war. Then the accompliſhment of time being come, the Fifth age of the World ended, And our Saviour and Redeemer Jeſus Chriſt was born, very God and very Man, in the year of the Creation of the World, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Hebrews, Three thouſand nine hundred fifty and two years. And according to the ſeventy Interpretours, <hi>Euſebius</hi> and the greateſt part of Hiſtorians. Five thouſand a hundred ninety nine years. According to <hi>Orozine,</hi> five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand twenty years. According to <hi>Iſiodorus,</hi> one leſſe. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Alfonſus,</hi> ſix thouſand nine hundred eighty four; which is much more then any of the reſt.</p>
               <p>At this birth of our Lord begins the ſixth age, which hath laſted to this hour, and ſhall laſt even to the end of the world. And during the which, a great party of men, are governed by one man, onely the Emperour of the Romans. Theſe Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours have maintained themſelves in proſperity for ſome time, from one ſucceſſion to another: but aftewards came the Goths and other Nations, and then <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who have given ſo many traverſings to this Empire, that it is much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:175728:26"/>in ſuch ſort, that in many quarters of it there are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Kingdomes and Signiories taken out. By which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords and coldneſſe of faith, the enemies of the Church of Chriſt hath found means to moleſt the faithfull Chriſtians, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting many of them out of their Teretories and Provinces.</p>
               <p>Theſe computations of the times of the ages which I have recited, are taken out of the Authors alledged, St. <hi>Auguſtine, Iſiodorus, Beda, Euſebius, Filo, Oraſine,</hi> ſingular Hiſtorians. And for Modern <hi>Pierre d' Aliaque,</hi> and above all <hi>John Driodon</hi> in his Eccleſiaſticks. The Poets gives the world four ages and no more. The firſt of Gold; The ſecond of Silver; The third of Braſſe; And the fourth of Iron: ſhewing thereby, that the malice of men beginning to encreaſe, the excellency of mettals decreaſed, to which they compared the world.

               <p>The firſt Age is named the infancy, continuing the time of 4 years, in which domineers the neareſt Planet to the earth, which is the moon. Becauſe the qualities of infancy, compels us to ſay that the influence of that Planet, is of all others agreeable to that Age, in which the body is moiſt, delicate, tender, weak, and moveable, and in al things like to the moon, for a ſmal thing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters it. Its members for a little ſmal thing is weakned, and the members are perceived to grow in a ſmal time even to ones eie. Theſe things hapned in general to all, becauſe of the moon, that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:175728:27"/>governs then. Nevertheleſſe, more to one than to another, and not equally, for as much as the other particular qualities, which hold nothing of the Moon, takes effect as the child is brought into the world, according to the ſtate and diſpoſition of the other Planets.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Age laſteth ten years,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Age. </seg>2</label> while it comes to four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen. Which the Latines call <hi>Pueritia,</hi> Childhood; wherein ends infancy, and begins youth. In this age reigns another Planet called <hi>Mercury,</hi> placed in the ſecond Heaven, this is a Celeſtiall body eaſie to change being good, with the good, and nought in the aſpect with the nought. Laſting this time, then nature compoſeth it ſelf to the quality of this Planet; for then young children begin to ſhew ſome principle of their ſpirit, be it in reading, writing, or muſick, and are then tractable, and docile, yet light in their purpoſes, inconſtant and change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>The third Age is eight years more,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Age. </seg>3</label> called by the Ancients <hi>Adoleſcentia,</hi> youthfull age; and continues from fourteen to two and twenty, during which raigns the third Planet called <hi>Venus;</hi> for man then begins to prompt by nature, able and ſtrong to engender, being enclined to love, and Ladies addict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſports, voluptuous banquets, and worldly pleaſures, and this we muſt ſearch into whether nature provokes the man to do this. For we muſt believe that man keeps ſtill his own free will, either to take or leave theſe inclinations or influences, and underſtand that neither the force of the Planets, nor the power of the Stars, can but nible at ſuch liberty, although they encline the ſenſative appetite, and the members and organs of a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane body.</p>
               <p>The fourth age purſues it ſelf till a man hath accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forty two years,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Age. </seg>4</label> and is called <hi>Iuventus,</hi> youth; the courſe of which laſts nineteen years, and hath for its Governour and Maſter, the Sun which is in the fourth heaven, called by the moſt ancient Aſtrologers, The Fountain of Light; The principall eye of the univerſe; King of Planets; And Heart of all the World. And like to it this Age, is the Prince of all the reſt. And the flower of the life. During which the ſences,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:175728:27"/>and the powers of the body and the ſpirits, maintain and hold their ful force. And then being a man of full underſtanding and courage, is made to know and chuſe the beſt things. He deſires to purchaſe wealth, and to get himſelf a good name, alwaies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to do well, briefly in all things, generally he evidently ſhews that the ſun raigns over him.</p>
               <p>The fifth Age is called <hi>Viril,</hi> manly,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Age. </seg>5</label> and according to the ſaid Authors, dures fifteen years, ſo goes on in purſuit to fifty ſix years, ſubject to the Planet <hi>Mars,</hi> which in it ſelf is nought, dangerous and hot, inclining men to covetouſneſſe, and making them chollerick, ſickly, temperate in eating and drinking, and conſtant in their actions.</p>
               <p>Then joining twelve to fifty ſix,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Age. </seg>6</label> you ſhall find Three-ſcore and eight years, which makes an end of the ſixth Age, called old Age, whereof <hi>Iupiter</hi> is the great Governour, which is a noble Planet, betokening Equity, Religion, Piety, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Chaſtity, provoking men to put an end to all la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and hazard, and to ſeek reſt. Men in this Age do all holy works, Love, Temperance, and Charity, ſeeking after credit accompanied with commendation, are honeſt and ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhame and diſgrace.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh and laſt Age,
<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Age. </seg>7</label> hath been limitted from three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore and eight to fourſcore and eight, and few are found that atteins unto it. It is called feeble and decrepit. Becauſe <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> commands-over it as the moſt flow and higheſt Planet, and environs all the others aboveſaid. His complexion is cold, dry, and melancholy, angry, and envious. By which means he draws theſe old people to a ſolitarineſſe, choller, penſiveneſſe, deſpite, and anger. He weakens their memory and their ſtrength, and loads them with anguiſh, ſorrow, languiſhing ſickneſſe, deep thoughts, and with a great deſire to undertake ſecret and hidden things, and which is more, they would be ſuperiors and maſters above all and be obeyed. And if we ever find any that goes beyond this age (at which in theſe daies we may wonder) he will return and grow again to be as in his infancy, and will have one touch again of the moon for his Planet, which was the Governour (as is ſaid
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:175728:28"/>before) of his firſt years. By reaſon whereof people do the ſame to them as you ſee them do to little children, following their humours and inclinations. I alledge, that this diviſion was the invention of the Aſtrologers, but let every one believe what he pleaſe.</p>
               <p>Now we will come to the diviſion of the Philoſophers, Phyſitians, and Poets, which are of divers opinions. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in this diſcourſe there are ſome things of note, I will treat of ſome of them to exerciſe ingenious wits.</p>
               <p>The great Philoſopher <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> let a mans life be as long as may be, makes but four diviſions of it. Comparing it to the four quarters of the year, ſaying, that infancy is the ſpring time, in which all things are in their flower, begins to grow and encreaſe. Youth he compares to Summer, for the heat and force which men have in that age. The Viril, or mans age, is to Autumn; becauſe in this time men have experience, are ripe, apt for good Counſel, and certain knowledge in all things. And he repreſents old age to winter, a time without fruit, troubleſome, diſpleaſing, and hath not the happineſſe of any fruit, but what hath been gathered in former times.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Varro</hi> a learned man amongſt the Romans divided the life of man into five parts, attributing to every one of them the ſpace of fifteen years. The firſt fifteen he calls Puerility be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to childiſhneſſe. The ſecond he calleth <hi>Adoleſcentia,</hi> youth; that is to ſay growing, becauſe in that time men grow. The other fifteen reaches to forty five years, and calleth it <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventus,</hi> which comes of the Latine word <hi>Juvare.</hi> To ſignifie a time of help, becauſe in this age men ſerve in actions of war, and Common-wealth affairs. And this Age is the ſtable and confirmed time of the life. From forty five to ſixty, he calls that the ripe age of man; becauſe in Latine ſuch men are called <hi>(Seniores)</hi> that is in reſpect of others behind them. Becauſe in this time men decline, and grow into old age which accompliſheth the reſt of the life after the ſixty years. Thus have you <hi>Varroes</hi> diviſion of the life of man.</p>
               <p>The Philoſopher <hi>Hypochras</hi> divides it into ſeven Ages. The firſt and ſecond, each of them ſeven years, which makes four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen;
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:175728:28"/>The third, of fourteen years, reacheth to twenty eight; The other two, each of them ſeven years; and reach to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two; The ſixt, of fourteen years, and reach to fifty ſix; And the reſt of the life he attributes to the ſeventh Age. The Philoſopher <hi>Solon,</hi> puts theſe ſeven parts into ten, dividing the third, the ſixt, and the ſeventh in the middeſt, ſo that every one of the ten parts, laſts ſeven years, There is the deſcription made by the Philoſophers. But <hi>Iſiodore</hi> hath diſtinguiſhed them into ſix Ages. The two firſt agreeing with <hi>Hypocras,</hi> making every one of them ſeven, and naming the firſt, infancy; the ſecond, puerility; from fourteen to twenty eight, he calls <hi>Adoleſcentia,</hi> or the growing age; from twenty eight to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he calleth youth, which is the fourth in order; the fifth, he calls the declining age, and which begins old age, he makes of twenty years, and are in all ſixty. The reſt of the life he attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes to old age, calling it the ſixth age.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Horace</hi> that excellent Poet, divides alſo the age of man; but it is in four parts onely; ſo doth <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> Namely, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erilty, youth, and the viril age, and old age, the which is ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly deſcribed in his Poetick-Art, with the qualities and conditions of men in every age.</p>
               <p>And nevertheleſſe, according to the Rule of the naturall Philoſophers. The life of man ought to be divided but in to three ages; The firſt, the growing age; The ſecond, that which a man continues all in one eſtate; The third, of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining time, Becauſe according to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> All things that are engendred have augmentation, a reteining of the eſſence, and a diminution: ſo they give to man three ages. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabian Phyſitians have been of the ſame opinion. Yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs <hi>Avicen,</hi> a learned man, diſtinguiſheth our life into four ages or principal parts. The firſt which laſts thirty years, he names <hi>Adoleſcen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ia</hi> youth; becauſe in this time all things goes forward in growing. The ſecond, from thirty to forty five, and he names it the time of ſtanding at a ſtay, or the time of beauty; becauſe in this time man is in perfection. From thence forward and even to ſixty, he calls the time of ſecret de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, and the way to old age; and all the time that a man
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:175728:29"/>lives afterwards, he calls cleer, and open old age. Yet we muſt note, that although he make this his principall diviſion, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides the firſt of theſe four which is the thirty years, and makes them into three parts, ſo that we may ſay he confirms thoſe which divide them into ſix. Now after al (conſidering theſe vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able opinions) I do not know which to take to for the moſt true, nor indeed, can there be any certain rule given, in reſpect of the divers complexions and diſpoſitions of men, as alſo the innabiting in divers Countries &amp; Provinces, and feeding upon good or naughty meats, by means whereof men arrive ſooner or later at old age. For this cauſe ſaith <hi>Gallen,</hi> we ought not to give a limitted time to ages, which being wel conſidered, wil make, that all theſe diſcordances of ſeverall Authors not to ſeem ſo ſtrange, ſeeing that every one of them have a divers conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereupon. As had <hi>Servius Tullius</hi> King of Rome, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Aulus Gelius</hi> had regard to nothing but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good, when he divided the people of Rome into five e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates. And ſeparated the life of man into three parts, naming the firſt age to ſeventeen, Puerity; and then to forty ſix, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared them men able and fit for war, and made them be liſted in writing; And after forty ſix he named them men ripe and fit for Counſel. This diviſion contraries not the others; becauſe it is univerſal and incloſes in it ſelf the leſſer and more particular, &amp; ſeems to conform it ſelf to the common diviſions, which divide the ages into youth ripe age, and old age. The Viril from the time we are born to the end of youth, which continues to 45 years, a little more or leſſe. So ſaith <hi>Virgil, Virediſ<expan>

The ripe age even to ſixty years, which <hi>Servius</hi> names wiſe, and fit for Councel, and the reſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit old age. The which three parts may be divided into leſſe and by that means confirms the truth, which ſeems to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Authors.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>What a dangerous thing it is to murmure against Princes, with a Commendation of their clemency.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is a very ancient ſaying, and prized a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the old Proverbs. That Kings have large hands, and very long ears, inferring thereby, that Kings and mighty men, can take vengeance a far off, upon thoſe that have offended againſt them, and alſo that they underſtand all things that are ſaid againſt them in ſecret: For there are ſo many people inſinuate themſelves into the love of thoſe that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that nothing can be hid from them. For this cauſe wiſe men Counſel, that no man ſpeak any thing againſt the King, though in ſecret, forasmuch as in this caſe, the walls hear, and ſpeak; and <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaith, that the birds carry the words through the air. So then we ſee that for ſpeaking truth, and freely, men fall into danger. What ſhall we judge then of him that murmurs againſt great ones? The examples that we may bring to this purpoſe are infinite. Amongſt which, we may read in the Greek and Latine Hiſtories, That <hi>Antigonus</hi> one of the Captains and ſucceſſors to <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, his Army being in the field, &amp; he being a bed in his Pavillion one night, heard ſome of his Souldiers without, that murmured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, not thinking that he heard them, and indeed he made no ſhew, ſaving in changing his voice (as if it had been ſome other) ſaid unto them, to hold ſuch a diſcourſe, you ſhould draw yourſelves further from the Kings Tent, leaſt he ſhould hear you. Another time this <hi>Antigonus</hi> cauſing his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to march one night through a muddy and a dirty place, his ſouldiers finding themſelves weary, went murmuring &amp; began to ſpeak much evil of him, thinking that he had been a great way behind, and had not heard them; yet being hard by them, he underſtood many of their injurious words, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:175728:30"/>without being known; becauſe it was night, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards relieving with all his power, a party of thoſe very men that had ſpoken evill of him, ſpake unto them (changing his voice) ſaying, Speak againſt the King what you pleaſe, for lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of you into this mirie place: but yet you ought to give me thanks, and love me, that I have brought you out of it again.</p>
               <p>The patience of <hi>Pyrrus,</hi> King of the Epyrotes, was no leſſe: For when he made war againſt the Romans in Italy, he and his people being lodged in the Town of Taraenta, there was ſome of his young ſouldiers, after they had ſupped together, began to ſpeak evill of him at the Table, whereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advertiſed, and warning them before him, asked them if it were true that they had ſpoken ſuch words? to which one of them anſwered boldly, yes; Sir, we have ſpoken all that you charge us with, and aſſure your ſelf, if the wine had held out at table and had not failed us, we ſhould have ſpoken much more, willing to ſhew thereby, in excuſe of themſelves, that the wine induced them to ſpeak evill of him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at <hi>Pyrrus</hi> was never a whit angry, but fell into laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſending them away without any reproof or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The Emperour <hi>Tyberius,</hi> although he were a great Tyrant, amongſt other things, hath left us to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, notable examples. For knowing that one had made an infamous Libell againſt him, and that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his people murmured at his cruelties, being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by ſome to do Juſtice upon them; anſwered magnanimouſly, That Tongues ought to be free in the Town. And being incited again by ſome of the Senate, to ſeek out for him that was the inventer of the Libell. Would not. Saying, he was not ſo out of buſineſſe as to trouble himſelf with that.</p>
               <p>The great mercy of <hi>Dennis</hi> the Tyrant of Sicily (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he were extream cruell) was marvellous kind towards an old woman; for being advertiſed, that this old woman prayed devoutly to the Gods for his
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:175728:30"/>health, and proſperity, ſent out to ſeek for her to be brought before him, and asked her for what cauſe ſhe prayed ſo heartily for him, ſeeing that all the reſt of his people univerſally deſired rather his death.</p>
               <p>To whom the old woman made anſwer, Know Sir, that when I was young, we had over us a moſt cruell Tyrant; wherefore I prayed devoutly to God for his death, and my prayer was heard. After him ſucceeded an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, which Tyrannized over this Kingdome more than the former, and I likewiſe deſired his death, ſo that by inceſſant prayers and requeſt to the Gods, deſired that as they had heard me for the firſt, ſo they would for this, which came to paſſe, and he died. In whoſe place now you are come, farre worſe than the two former. And becauſe that after you, I fear another may come worſe than all the three, I pray the Gods continually, that they would maintain you in long life. This free and bold an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of the old woman diſpleaſed him never a whit, but let her go cheerfully and freely. When <hi>Plato</hi> Prince of Philoſophers (who lived a long time with this Tyrant <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi>) asked him leave to return to Athens, and had obteined it. <hi>Dennis</hi> asked him, what he would ſay of him, in the Accademie amongſt the Philoſophers at Athens. To which <hi>Plato,</hi> with great boldneſſe and freedome anſwered, Thoſe which are at Athens, are not ſo idle, as to have leiſure to ſpeak of you or of your doings. <hi>Dennis</hi> underſtood well that he reproved him of his evill life; and yet nevertheleſſe, bore it patiently. I remember two other old women, which with no leſſe freedome ſpake to their Kings, which was taken patiently. One was of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> to King <hi>Demetrius,</hi> ſon of <hi>Antigonus</hi> before named, and the other a Roman to the Emperour <hi>Adrian.</hi> To whom both made a like anſwer, when demanding juſtice to be done them: It was anſwered by <hi>Demetrius</hi> and <hi>Adrian,</hi> that they could not underſtand them. To whom they anſwered, that if they could not underſtand them, they ſhould then leave the Empire; and yet neither of them both were angry at their
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:175728:31"/>anſwer, but heard them and did them true juſtice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philip</hi> King of Macedon, taking farewell of the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours of Athens, and making them fair offers as it is the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes in ſuch caſes, asked them if they would have him do any thing elſe for them, to whom, one of them, named <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus,</hi> knowing well that <hi>Philip</hi> extreamly hated the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, and could not conceal his mind, anſwered; We would have you hang your ſelf by the neck. At which anſwer all the reſt of his companions were much troubled. And thoſe alſo that were there preſent, for fear leaſt the King ſhould do them ſome evill; but according to his Clemency (or it may be he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled) made no other ſhew, but turning towards the other Ambaſſadours ſaid, you may tell the Athenians, That he that can bear ſuch words, is much more modeſt then the wiſe Athenians, which have not had the diſcretion to hold their peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Demorates</hi> went to ſee this King <hi>Philip,</hi> at a time when he was angry with his wife, and his ſon <hi>Alexander.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other diſcourſe, <hi>Philip</hi> asked of their peace and union amongſt the Towns in Greece. And <hi>Demorate</hi> knowing well that the King delighted to hear of diſcord between thoſe Common-wealths, anſwered him indeed too freely, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom he ſpake to, Truly King, becauſe you are at diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in your own houſe, you enquire after the diſcention of our Towns: But if you were at peace with your own, it would be more commendable than to enquire of the adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of others. And nevertheleſſe, the King was not angry, but ſeeing that he was juſtly taxed, ſought peace with his wife and his ſon.</p>
               <p>And if we would have examples of Chriſtians, That of Pope <hi>Sextus</hi> the fourth, who was of the order of St. <hi>Francis,</hi> will fit well to this purpoſe. Being come to be Pope, one of his Religious Brothers very ancient, went to viſit him in his Cordelier habit. To whom the Pope ſhewed his rich Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els and Rings, ſaying, Brother, I cannot now ſay as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid, Gold nor Silver have I none. It is true anſwered the Frier plainly; No more can you ſay as he ſayed to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:175728:31"/>and ſick of the Palſie, Riſe, and walk: giving to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand thereby, That the Popes were already more ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to become rich, than to become Saints. And the Pope which knew his brother ſpeak reaſon, took it patiently.</p>
               <p>There hapned almoſt the ſame to an Arch-Biſhop of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, by a Country labouring man. For one day as this poor man was at work in the field, the Arch-Biſhop paſſed by ſomewhat near him, having a Train of Guard armed in the German manner. And the Clown, at the paſſing by of the Arch-Biſhop fel into a great laughter; which the Biſhop perceiving, asked what moved him to laughter, The Country man an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, I laugh at St <hi>Peter</hi> Prince of Prelates, which lived and died in great poverty, to leave his ſucceſſours rich. The Arch-Biſhop who found himſelf touched, to juſtifie himſelf anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, My friend, I go ſo well attended becauſe I am a Duke as well as a Biſhop, which the poor labourer hearing, he fell a laughing much more than before. And asking him again why he laughed, He anſwered very boldly, I would my Lord you would tell me, if this Duke you ſpeak of ſhould be in Hell, where do you think then would be the Atch-Biſhop? inferring thereby, that two profeſſions could not be in one man; for offending in one, he could not be juſtified in the other. To which anſwer the Arch-Biſhop, ducking down his head, made no reply, but without any injury or diſpleaſure ſhewed to the labourer, went his way aſhamed.</p>
               <p>To ſpeak of Heathens, <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> King of Perſia, knew that a Captain named <hi>Alcides,</hi> whom he had brought up from his youth murmured ſore againſt him, for which he gave him no other chaſtiſement but ſent for him, and told him that he might ſpeak what he would of his King, becauſe the King could as well ſpeak and do what he would with him. <hi>Philip</hi> the father of <hi>Alexander,</hi> having underſtood that <hi>Nicanor</hi> ſpake evill of him in publick, was counſelled by ſome to ſend for him and puniſh him t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o which he anſwered, that <hi>Nicanor</hi> was not the worſt man in his Kingdome, and he would know if he wanted not ſomething; becauſe he held himſelf tied to relieve him, when being advertized that <hi>Nicanor</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:175728:32"/>was in great poverty, inſtead of punniſhing him for the fault he had committed, ſent him a rich preſent; at which, he that had accuſed him ſaid unto the King, that <hi>Nicanor,</hi> went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſtreets ſpeaking graciouſly of him, to whom the King anſwered. Now I ſee <hi>Simicus</hi> (for ſo the accuſer was named) that it is in my power to make men ſpeak well, or ill of me.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Philip</hi> was again counſelled to baniſh out of his Kingdome an ill-tongued fellow, and one that ſcandalized him very much. To which he anſwered, that he would not have any ſuch thing done; becauſe he that would villifie him in his own Country; he would not have him go to do the like in a ſtrange Country, giving to underſtand, that what he gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by clemency, and nobleneſſe, proceeded from wiſedome and good Counſel. This Prince was in theſe things and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others very excellent; He would ſay he was bound to give thanks to the Governours and Princes of Athens; becauſe by reaſon that they ſpake continually evill of him, and of his actions, to make them liars, he would every day grow better and better, in the amendment and correcting of his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He would never puniſh them that ſpake evill of him, but rather take away the occaſion. Which rules be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well obſerved by us, would yeeld us great profit, two waies: The one to amend our lives: The other, that we ſhould not have ſo many Detractors. It is truly a great vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue not to be much troubled at any evill, that we know is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken againſt us in our abſence. And it is a greater temperance not to be moved, or grow ſour at an injury that is offered to us in our preſence.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough the works of nature are wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and an argument of the infinit pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Creator of all things, yet theſe that are ordinary and well underſtood by learned and knowing men, cauſe not ſuch wonder, as is the birth and growth of Man, Beaſts, and Plants, and the production of their fruits, and all other like ordinary things. There are again others that are not ſo common, which nevertheleſſe do not ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſh us with admiration of their nature, although we wonder to ſee things which ſeem to repugn, the common or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and eſſence of themſelves, as ſome are which are recited by the authority of great and learned men. <hi>Pontanus</hi> a knowing man, and very famous for learning, ſaith, That he and others have ſeen in a high Mountain by the Sea near Naples, a great piece of a ſtone or flint, which fell from thence by chance, to the which ſtone grew a great tree ſo faſt joined, that it ſeemed nature brought it forth, and cauſed it to grow ſo together with the Stone, even as if it had been but one body, though it were perfect wood; which ſeems proceeded no other waies than the earth or the water mingled with the tree, which afterwards came to be converted into ſtone, and cloſed it in on all ſides, and thus becauſe it was (perhaps) in a place little frequented by any body, was wonderfull, and ſeemed hard to comprehend. An other thing is recited by <hi>Alexander</hi> of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria, as much wonderful, which hapned in Naples where he dwelt; which is, That an Artificer being at work upon a Marble ſtone, for a certain building, and ſawing it in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle there was found in it a Diamond of great value, ready po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed and trimmed by mans hand.</p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:175728:33"/>
               <p>The ſame <hi>Alexander</hi> recites, that working upon an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther marble ſtone, and deſiring to ſaw it in the middle, they found it very hard, ſo that they were forced to break it with a Pick-ax, which the Maſons uſe, and there they found in the middeſt of it a great quantity of oyl cloſed up, as though it had been in a bottle or ſome other veſſel, and that this oil was of a clear, fair, and very good ſavour. <hi>Baptiſta Fulgoſa</hi> in his firſt book of Collections, ſaith. That there hath been ſeen, and certifies, that in a Mountain, a great way off from any Sea, there was found, a hundred fathams deep in the earth, a ſhip over-whelmed and conſumed in the earth, but not ſo conſumed, but that one might perceive the ſhape of a ſhip; where was alſo found Anchors of Iron, and the Maſt, and the Sail-yard, though broken and conſumed. And that which was moſt wonderfull is, that there was found the bones at the leaſt of forty perſons. And theſe things were ſeen in the year 1460. Some that ſaw it, would not believe but that it had there been covered with earth over <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Others were of opinion, that this might be ſome ſhip which had been caſt away in the Sea, and that through the inward concavity or hollowneſſe of the earth, the water forced it even thither, whither ſince by the alteration of time, the earth became dry, and ſo there it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained fixt. But let it be which way it will, the chance was wonderful.</p>
               <p>The ſame Author recites again, that a Stone being cut in the middle, there was found in it a living worm which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to have any nouriſhmen tbut from the ſtone.</p>

                  <p>That the Imagination is one of the principal interiour powers, proved by true examples, and notable Hiſtories.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the outward Sences are five in number, as every one knows, that is to ſay Hearing. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the reſt, So there are five interiour ſences or powers in man, and yet ſome reduce them into four; but the firſt is the common opinion, namely the common ſence. The Imagination (whereof we will onely ſpeak now.) The Judgement The Fantaſie, and the Memory. Of the Office and virtue of which ſences, we do not intend now to treat of, but we will ſpeak of the ſence of Imagination, the property and office whereof is to retein and keep thoſe Images and Figures that the common ſence receives, firſt from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour ſence, and then ſends it to the Judgement; from whence afterwards it comes to the Fancy, and there locked up and coffered in the memory. And we may he Imagination alter and move with the repreſentation of things, although it have them not preſent, which, the common ſence cannot have unleſſe they be preſent. In which is ſhewed the greatneſs and marvellous force of the Imagination. We ſee a man a ſleep, and his ſences all at reſt, and yet his Imagination ceaſeth not to work, and to preſent things to him as if they were preſent, and the man awak. The Imagination is able to move the paſſions and affections of the ſoul, and can diverſly provoke the body to change the accidents: Turn the ſpirits, the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, lowermoſt, and turn the inſide outwards, and likewiſe produce divers qualities to the members. Imagination can make a man ſick or well. And ſo we ſee that it hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther effects alſo. When the Imagination conceives ſomething of pleaſure, Joy caſts the ſpirits out. And ſo of Fear, that
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:175728:34"/>draws them inward. Joy inlargeth the heart, Sorrow pens it up. The Imagination of fear, begets cold, and makes the heart to quake, puts heat to flight, and makes the tongue and words to tremble. The pitty, that is cauſed and put forward by the Imagination to ſee an other ſuffer, makes many times him that ſeeth to change more than him that ſuffers, as we know many times, ſome ſtanders by will ſwoon to ſee another let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloud, and alter more at the dreſſing of a wound, or the like, thau the Patient. A ſtrong Imagination hath power to change things, as when we hear or ſee one eat any thing that is ſharp or ſower, we feel a kind of ſowerneſſe in our mouth, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one cat ſweet or ſavoury things, we ſeem to taſt a kind of ſweetneſſe in our mouth, and ſo of bitter things.</p>
               <p>If we would have examples of ſtrange Imaginations we may have many. St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, he knew a man that as often as he liſt, would ſweat aboundantly, ſtirring by his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination the expulſive virtue.</p>
               <p>He makes mention of an other, which at the hearing of a ſong or any mournful tune, or if a man ſhould cry or weep, he would begin to imagine, and then faint and fall away in ſuch ſort, that he would be without any manner of ſence, that even if you ſhould burn him, he would not feel you; and yet if one had ſung any pleaſant tune, he would come to himſelf again. <hi>Plinie</hi> reports almoſt the like thing of one called <hi>Hermotim,</hi> who when he fel into Imagination, he changed in ſuch ſort that his ſpirits were gone out of his body, and then comming again to himſelf he would tel what he had ſeen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Guillaum de Paris,</hi> ſaith, he knew a man that onely with ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Purgation, and never taſted it, apprehending it by a ſtrong Imagination, had as many ſtools as he that took it.</p>
               <p>It is ſo with them which dream, for ſuppoſe it is the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that cauſeth it, yet if in the dream they are burned they will feel pain although there be no fire to burn. Strong Imagination can with ſuch force move the kinds of things, that ſhe imprints in them the Figure of things imagined, and then ſetteth them to work in the bloud, and this is of ſuch force, that it even extends it ſelf to the members of a third perſon, as we ſee in women
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:175728:34"/>with child, which by means of a ſtrong imagination, that ſhe hath of the thing ſhe deſires to eat (which is called longing) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times the print or figure of the thing is found upon the child; And ſometimes ſhe dies. So often times it happens with him that is bitten with a mad dog, by the Imagination that he hath of the dog, there will be ſeen in his urine, the ſhape of a dog. To this purpoſe it is written of one King <hi>Cypus,</hi> who having with great attention behold a combat betwixt two buls one day fell a ſleep, having the imagination of this combat in his mind, and when he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>kened he found two little horns like buls horns, growing upon his head; if this bet true, it muſt needs proceed from hence, that the vegitative virtue, being help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and forced by the imagination, it carried the proper humors of engendring horns into the head, and ſo brought them forth.</p>
               <p>As we have ſaid before, the imaginative virtue hath ſuch power and force ouer the bodies of the third perſon, that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcene</hi> recites, That in the confines of Piſce, in a place called <hi>S. Peters,</hi> a woman was brought to bed of a ſavage ſhe-child, having the skin in the form and likeneſſe of that of a Camel, which happened by reaſon, that at the conception of that child, ſhe was contemplating upon the image of <hi>S. Iohn Baptist,</hi> that ſhe had in her chamber: So that as we have ſaid of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the Imagination hath ſuch power, that it can make the children reſemble thoſe perſons that the parents do imagine and think of. <hi>Avicen</hi> alſo is of opinion, that the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be ſo ſtrong, that it may make a man ſuddenly be deprived of the uſe of his limbs, and caſt him to the ground, tormenting him as if he were mad. And he ſaith more, that the Enchantment which it brings by the eys, pierceth or ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth through one perſon to another, by the imagination of him that cauſeth the charm. So <hi>S. Thomas</hi> ſpeaking after <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicon,</hi> asks, which ſooneſt kills a body, the melancholy ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, or the delectable imagination, by the violence of the one or the other? Joy expels and forceth out the ſpirits, and leaves a man without life; the other binds them in ſo ſtrong, that thereby grows a violent ſuffocation. We ſaw in <hi>Sivile James Oſorius,</hi> who was taken by the Catholick King by
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:175728:35"/>the ſtrong imagination of the fear which he conceived, became old, and white haired, onely in one night, being the day before ſtrong and young. Again we ſee, that imagination many times makes men become fools: and at ſuch times ſo ill and crazie, that its effects and power is wonderfull.</p>

Be it how it will, this <hi>Pilate</hi> (either for reſpect to his perſon, or to his parentage) came to be of great note in Rome; and being known to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> ſucceſſour to <hi>Octavius,</hi> according to <hi>Joſephus</hi> and <hi>Euſebius,</hi> was ſent by him in the twelfth year of his Empire, to govern Jeruſalem, and ſtiled him with the dignity of Proctor of the Empire. So then <hi>Pilate</hi> govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the holy City, and all the Province of Judea, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Paleſtina. And he held this Officeren years; in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth of which, and the eighteenth of the Emperor <hi>Tiberius,</hi> according to <hi>Euſebius</hi> and <hi>Beda,</hi> he gave ſentence of death upon the Saviour and Redeemer of all mankind, our Lord <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> God and Man: at which time came to paſſe thoſe things which are written by the holy Evangeliſts, of his Death and Paſſion; whoſe Reſurrection was ſo publick in Jeruſalem, although they ſought by all means to hide it; that <hi>Pilate</hi> thought (although he were wicked) that ſuch Reſurrection and Miracles were not of humane power, but of God. For
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:175728:35"/>this cauſe (as <hi>Euſebius</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> recites) he adverti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Emperour <hi>Tyberius,</hi> for it was the cuſtome of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls and Pro-conſuls, to advertiſe the Emperour or the Senate what things happened in their Provinces.</p>
               <p>This news marvellouſly amazed the Emperour, which made him refer it to the Senate, to ſit ill Councel, to know if it migh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But as the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Chriſt hath no need to confirm it ſelf, by the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of men onely, God ſuffered that the Senators would do nothing in it. On the contrary (as theſe Authours ſay) they were diſpleaſed that <hi>Pilate</hi> had not writ to them as well as to <hi>Tyberius,</hi> yet for all this, <hi>Tyberius</hi> forbad the further perſecution of Chriſtians, After theſe things <hi>Pilate</hi> coming to live in Rome, and confirmed by the Devil for his loyal ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, did never after do any thing in his Office, but unjuſt and unlawfull acts. Whereof being accuſed before <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus Caligula,</hi> Succeſſour to <hi>Tyberius.</hi> And alſo to have profaned the Temple, by putting in Statues and Images, and to have robbed the common Treaſury and other grievous crimes, was baniſhed to the town of Lions; ſome ſay to Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna in Dauphenie, and becauſe this place was aſſigned for his baniſhment ſome ſay that this was the place of his birth, he was ſo handled, that he killed himſelf with his own hands, which was by divine permiſſion, that he might die by the hand of the moſt wickeddeſt man in the world, <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſaith, that he killed himſelf eight years after the death of our Saviour, of which this accuſed <hi>Pilate</hi> made no profit to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, foraſmuch as he died in deſpair. For the goodneſſe of God is ſo great, that although he had condemned his ſon to death, yet if he had repented him of his ſin, him whom he had condemned to die, would have given him eternall life. And now we ſpeak of <hi>Pilate,</hi> I remember of a Lake ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; this Lake is in Suiſſe, near a Town called Lucerna, in a Plain environed with very high Mountains, from the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:175728:36"/>of which (as ſome ſay) he caſts himſelf into the water. And the common report is, that every year he ſhews himſelf there in his Judges habit, but whoſoever it be that by chance happens to ſee him, either man or woman dies, within the year. Over and beyond this, I will bring upon the ſtage to witneſſe it, <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>achin Vadian,</hi> a learned man, who expounded <hi>Pomponius Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la;</hi> he writes alſo an other notable thing of this Lake, very true and wonderfull: he ſaith, it hath ſuch a property, that if any one caſt a ſtone into it, or a piece of wood, or any other thing, this Lake ſwels and grows into ſuch a boiſterous Tempeſt, that it runs beyond its bounds in great fury, in ſuch ſort that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it drowns a great part of the Country, from whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds great loſſe and damage, as well to trees and Plants as to beaſts: and nevertheleſſe if theſe things are not caſt in expreſly it ſwels not at all. And this <hi>Ioachin</hi> ſaith further, that there are Edicts that forbids upon pain of life, for any one to caſt any thing into this Lake; and that divers that have tranſgreſſed this edict have been executed; whether this proceeds of a naturall cauſe or by a miracle I know not, howſoever ſome waters have great and wonderfull properties, part whereof there may be reaſons given for, and for others none.</p>

Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt this King lived proſperouſly in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, he had by one of his wives lawfully born, a brave man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child, healthfull, and well accompliſhed in all his members and ſences, which came to a convenient age, that he might have formed his voice to ſpeak: nevertheleſſe, by ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known ſtring or hinderance of the tongue, he ſpake not, nor a long time after, although he were already grown, and fit for any enterprize. By means whereof he was reputed dumb, although he heard and underſtood, which is contrary to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of nature, for never any was known to be dumb that was not deaf. Now it came to paſſe that <hi>Croſus</hi> was vanquiſhed, and the town wherein he was, was taken by the enemy, ſo that the ſouldiers went up even to the Pallace, in which was this dumb child hidden with his father in a corner, and being found by a ſouldier which knew them not, the ſouldier drew near unto <hi>Creſus,</hi> and drew his ſword to kill him, the child being affrighted at ſuch a ſpectacle, wrought ſuch a ſtrong paſſion in him which made him ſpeak aloud, the extream working that the Soveraignty of the ſoul hath over the body! immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately the corporal organs obeyed to the ſtrong determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the will, in ſuch ſort, that breaking the ſtrings that tied the tongue, he pronounced, and ſpake with a high voice,

Which being underſtood by the Souldier, he drew back his blow and killed him nor, who for that time eſcaped death: and from that time forward, the child ſpake, as if he could have ſpoken all his life time before, which is a wonderfull thing; and yet I know no naturall reaſon that can be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently given for it. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, that all men are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly born deaf and dumb, becauſe they are not brought forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world with the diſpoſition of theſe two ſences, nor in ſuch perfection that there is any need of them; and that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in growing, it diſpoſeth it ſelf and begins firſt to hear; and after a certain time that it can hear, it begins to ſpeak. <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie</hi> ſaith alſo, that he that is born and remains deaf, he muſt of neceſſity be dumb; for it is certain, if the deaf could hear he would learn to ſpeak, &amp; that it is unpoſſible to teach him that cannot hear. And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith alſo, that it may happen that a child may pronounce ſome words before the ordinary time; yet nevertheleſſe, he ſhall looſe that kind of ſpeech, when the time comes that is granted to children to ſpeak, and then they ſhall ſpeak. To this purpoſe <hi>Plinie</hi> recounts of the child of <hi>Creſus,</hi> of whom we have ſpoken before, and ſaith, that at five moneths old he pronounced certain words, which were reputed the prognoſtication of his fathers ruine, and it ſeems that prognoſtication took effect, for he was never heard to ſpeak after till that time hapned that we have ſpoken of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. I remember an other thing that happened in the like caſe, recited by <hi>Alben Regel</hi> in his Judiciary, where he ſpeaks, as an eye-witneſſe, that a King in whoſe Court he lived, had a child, that at four and twenty hours after his birth began to ſpeak perfectly and ſtir his hands, at which all that were by, wondering, underſtood that it ſaid plainly. I am unhappily born, ſeeing that I muſt pronounce that the King my father muſt looſe his Scepter, and that his Kingdome muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroied. At the end of which words he alſo ended his life. This was a fearfull thing, and yet me thinks this was an advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſent from God, which wrought marvellouſly in nature. The Aſtrologers ſay, that he that is born under Mercury, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendant
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:175728:37"/>Eaſt, ſhal ſpeak ſooner then any other that ſpeaks ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ordinary courſe of nature.</p>
               <p>I remember yet an other thing anſwerable to this that we have ſaid, which is. That ſome are of opinion. That ſpeech is not a thing naturall to man, but gained and learned, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Arts and ſciences. Others ſay, in that we ſpeak natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, it is not a thing proper and peculiar to man onely. The firſt that are of opinion that ſpeech is not a natural thing ſtrive to prove it, ſaying it muſt be of force, that that which meets naturally in one kind, muſt be agreeable to all of that kind, even as we ſee barking to all dogs, lowing to buls, and ſo in like caſe to all other kind of Beaſts, and yet nevertheleſſe, we ſee in men one ſpeaks in one manner, another in another, in ſuch ſort that naturally they underſtand not one another, whereby it ſeems that ſpeech comes rather by art then na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Again according to <hi>Plinie,</hi> there are a ſort of people to be found that ſpeak not, but their ſpeech is rather a kind of lowing or bellowing, then words, which would not happen if all ſpoke by the gift of nature, for if it were ſo, all would ſpeak in one ſelf ſame manner, as for the opinion of others which ſay, that ſpeech is not particularly proper to man, they ground themſelves upon that which <hi>Luctantius Firmian</hi> faith, that we have ſome parts in us which ſeem proper one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to man, and nevertheleſſe we find them in other creatures, as the diverſity of voice in birds, by whoſe chanting, we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern one from another, and yet we ſee they hold ſecret intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence one with another, in ſuch manner as you would think they were all but of one kind of language, yet they take their argument from this, that we ſee divers birds ſpeak as Parots, Magpies, and the like. But the truth of this thing is, (albeit their opinion had ſome appearance of truth) that ſpeech hath been given by God to Man, not that he gains it by Art, and that it is proper and peculiar to him onely, and not to any other creature. True it is, that other creatures have voice, yet they have not ſpeech. And ſuch is the opinion of <hi>Quintillia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> and likewiſe of <hi>Aristotle.</hi> So we have a good anſwer to the contrary reaſons. As to the firſt argument we may anſwers
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:175728:38"/>That a thing may be natural univerſally. But in particular it may execute at pleaſure; it is naturally ill done, and that man deſerves puniſhment, which kils another, or robs him of his goods; yet nevertheleſs to puniſh him rather one way than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, proceeds from the pleaſure of the Judge: Therefore, although men ſpeak divers languages, yet we muſt not ſay that ſpeech comes not to them by nature, and by ſo much the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is ſtronger, that ſuch diverſity and confuſion of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, have been for the puniſhment of pride upon them which builded the Tower of <hi>Babel.</hi> For as we have ſaid, there was but one language in the world, and that was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. And as for the Troglodites which ſcarce ſpeak at all, they ſay the reaſon is, becauſe their language is barbarous and imperfect, and ſavours nothing of humanity; nevertheleſſe this was a language by which they underſtood one another. And as it is ſaid again, that there are ſome birds that ſpeak, as Parots, as <hi>Lewis Celie</hi> recites, one of Cardinal <hi>Askanius,</hi> which in his preſence pronounced word after word all the Creed in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine and miſſed not a ſyllable. One may anſwer, that this is not ſpeech; for they know not what they ſay; but it is a certain cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, in teaching them for many daies together, to frame ſuch a voice. And then, true ſpeech before it be pronounced is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the heart, of which birds are defective, and alſo to that argument which ſaith, we know creatures by the diverſity of their voice, and that they underſtand and call one to another a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves; yet it is not to be ſaid, that ſuch a voice is a form of ſpeech; for as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, the voice looſeth it ſelf: ſo may we without forming any word or ſpeech, ſignifie or give to underſtand joy, or anger, and all other univerſall paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as we ſee by the voice which we make in laughing, and pleaſure; and by the ſighs and cries that are made, by thoſe that mourn. And for brute beaſts, which have a difference either in their note or in their voice, one may know when they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed or pleaſant, by moving of themſelves, or by high flying, where they make ſome other ſign according to the occaſion; even ſo words and ſpeech, by which we ſhew particularly what is profitable, what is neceſſary, what hurtful, malice, Juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:175728:38"/>injuſtice, honeſty, and goodneſſe. And by which, more, one may tell of things paſt, and provide for the future by reaſons and words which declares it, and produce other profitable things by ſpeech which is onely given unto man, and he hath it of his proper nature.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Arriage is contracted with the conſent onely of the man and woman. But to the end that this conſent be better authorized, and remain inviolable, it is requiſite to declare it in words and outward ſigns; becauſe God onely knows and underſtands the heart. From hence it comes, that men have inſtituted divers ceremonies and ſolemn words. As for thoſe of the Chriſtians, they are wel enough known, and therefore there is no need that I ſhould ſpeak of them. Wherefore I will treat onely of ſome cuſtomes, which barbarous nations and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans were wont to uſe at their marriages, the diverſity where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may yield a little pleaſure. The ancient Romans perhaps, according to <hi>Cicero,</hi> married two manner of waies, ſo had they two ſorts of wives, according to the divers Ceremonies of their marriage. The one was more common, and called her ſelf the Matron, the other called her ſelf the mother of the family; theſe it ſeems married almoſt as the Chriſtians do now. For the husband asked the wife, if ſhe would be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and dame of his family, and ſhe anſwered, Yes: ſhe in the like caſe, asked the husband, if he would be father of her family, and he anſwered, he would. Then they took one another and clapt hands, and this form of marriage was held for the moſt excellent: ſo this wife hath in the houſe and family of her husband ſuch a place, as if ſhe were the daughter of the houſe; becauſe ſhe is now placed in the number of the proper linage, &amp; as a daughter, comes to ſucceed in the heritage of her husband. <hi>Boecius</hi> ſpeaks of it amply, writing upon the 2 of the Tropicks of <hi>Cicero.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:175728:39"/>
               <p>The other Ceremony was common and by ordinary words, and did not take themſelves for mothers of the family, but they were called Matrons. The Romans had further this cuſtome, that bringing the Bride to the husbands houſe, ſhe ſets her down at the door, and will not enter till ſuch time as ſhe be drawn in by force, to let them know by that ſhe is conſtrained by force into that place, where ſhe muſt looſe her virginity. Then when they give the wife into the power of the husband, they make her ſit down in her mothers lap, from whence the husband muſt take her by force, and the Bride holds faſt about the mother and embraces her hard; and this is done in memory, that anciently the daughters of the Sabins had been taken by force by the Romans: by means of which force it ſucceeded well to an encreaſement of that people, yet before it came to this, the Bride muſt touch fire and water, which was done as <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Luctantius</hi> ſaith, to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the generation by theſe two elements, becauſe theſe are the two principal generative cauſes of all things. Others ſay, it was to demonſtrate to the woman the ſincerity and loyalty of heart, which ſhe ought to keep, becauſe water waſhes and makes clean all filthineſſe, and by fire are purged evil mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and refines mettals. They hold it for an ill preſage to marriages that are ſolemnized in the moneth of May, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of ſome ſuperſtitious vanities that they have amongſt them. Theſe things <hi>Ovid</hi> certifies, and <hi>Plutarch.</hi> They had a further cuſtome that when the Bride entred in at the door of the houſe of the Bride-groom. He pronounced with a high voice <hi>Caja Cecilia,</hi> and ſhe <hi>Cajo Cecilio.</hi> And this was becauſe that in the time of <hi>Tarquin Priſque,</hi> King of the Romans, he had a very chaſt wife, ſober, wiſe, and endued with many virtues, named <hi>Caje Cecilie</hi> before ſhe came to Rome, ſhe was called <hi>Tanaquile.</hi> Therefore the husband pronounceth theſe words to put his wife in mind to imitate her. They carry alſo a diſtaff furniſhed with Flax, and a ſpindle before the Bride going to the Bridegrooms houſe, to put her in mind that ſhe muſt exerciſe good houſewifery. Of theſe things <hi>Plinie</hi> ſpeaks. Theſe Romans had yet another
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:175728:39"/>cuſtome: That when a men married a widdow, the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding was kept upon a Feſtival or Holy day. But if a Maid, they were kept upon a working day. Of this, <hi>Macrobius</hi> and <hi>Plutarch</hi> are the Authors: And <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaith, that the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of the wedding upon the Feaſt daies was expreſſely, becauſe then all the people be taken up with recreations and pleaſures, then the wedding of the widdows was leſſe taken notice of. And on the contrary, they celebrated the Maids wedding upon working daies, that they might be ſeen of all: But <hi>Macrobius</hi> ſaith, that the Maids were not married upon the Feaſt daies, becauſe (as we have ſaid) they made it a cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to take her by force from her mothers lap, which could not be done upon a Feſtival day. I forbear to ſpeak of other ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies and ſolemnities of the Romans, to come to thoſe of the Babylonians: Whoſe manner of marrying their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters was, that upon one certain day in the year they brought their daughters to a publick place in the Town, and the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of them were married, not for any portion was given with her, but to him that would give moſt mony to have her, and the ſame courſe they took with them that were leſſe fair, to leſs fair, and from degree to degree till they come to the moſt ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſt of all, which afterwards are married with mony to him that will take leaſt, which portion proceeds out of the mony given by thoſe that took the faireſt at a high price; and by this means the foul one are as wel married as the fair ones, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving any mony.</p>

The ancient French to the end their daughters might not complain of marrying againſt their mind, had a cuſtome, the day that they would marry their daughter, to invite a number of young men but all of ſuch quality as might ſeem fitting for her eſtate; at which feaſt they ſuffered their daughter to chooſe a husband a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe that were invited, and to ſhew a ſign who ſhe moſt liked, ſhe preſents him water to waſh his hands.</p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:175728:40"/>
               <p>In a Town in Affrica called Leptine, there was a cuſtome, that the firſt day that the wife entred into the houſe of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, ſhe ſends to borrow an earthen pot of her mother in law who makes anſwer that ſhe will not lend it her: which is done that ſhe accuſtome her ſelf from the firſt day to endure, and bear with her mother in law, and with that churliſh anſwer, learn to endure when ſhe gives a true one.</p>
               <p>The Arabes, of Arabia the happy, had anciently a cuſtom, that the married wife was common to all the kindred of the husband: And as <hi>Strabo</hi> ſaith, when any of them went to her, he left at the entry of the door a little wand, that if any other ſhould come, he might know the place was taken up, and that he muſt not enter, for they had that reſpect one to another; and he was puniſhed with death, which entred in to a woman if he were not of kindred. Now it happened that a very fair and beautiful woman, was for that cauſe often viſited by the kindred of her husband, by means of which importunity and frequent viſitation, ſhe ſet at her door a little wand, to the end that whoſoever ſhould come, ſhould think that there were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other before him; and by this deceipt, for many daies, no man entred, till one day all the kindred and the husband were toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one place, one of them reſolved to leave the reſt &amp; viſite her; and finding the wand at the door, &amp; knowing that he had left all the reſt of the kindred together, thought that ſome adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer had been with her, wherefore he went preſently to adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe the reſt, &amp; eſpecially the husband; who being come thither, found her all alone, and confeſſed the cauſe why ſhe had done ſo: which when they conſidered, and found that her intention was grounded upon virtue, to the end to ſhun the diſhoneſt converſation of ſo great a number of kindred of her husbands, and alſo to live in greater temperance and chaſtity, which was contrary to the brutiſh uſe and cuſtome of the Country, and having in their opinion juſt reaſon for what ſhe did, ſhe was rather praiſed and commended then blamed.</p>

                     </gap>ſiod,</hi> have thought that water was the beginning of all things, and the ancienteſt of all elements: and again the moſt powerfull; for as <hi>Plinio</hi> ſaith, and likewiſe <hi>Iſiodorus,</hi> water ruines and diſſolves Mountains, reigns over the earth, extinguiſheth fire, and converting it ſelf into vapours, ſurpaſſeth the Region of the air, whence afterwards it deſcends to engender and bring forth all things upon the earth. So God eſteemed of water, that having concluded to regenerate man again By Baptiſm, that he would it ſhould be by the means of that element. And that when he divided the waters; at the beginning of the world, he had them in ſuch eſteem as the text ſaith, that he ſet them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and placed the waters above the firmament, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending that which compaſſeth the earth.</p>
               <p>The greateſt puniſhment which the Romans give to thoſe that were condemned, was that they prohibited them water and fire, putting water before fire for its dignity. Seeing then that water is ſo neceſſary for mans life, we ought with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and care, to find out that which is the beſt. For which purpoſe I will note ſome properties of water, alledged by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle Plinie</hi> and <hi>Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſcorides,</hi> and others, ſpeaking of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of waters.</p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:175728:41"/>
               <p>The firſt inſtruction is, That if a man travell into ſtrange Countries, and would know if the waters there are good for his uſe, either there, or to tranſport them ſome where elſe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his occaſion, let him obſerve and conſider the neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Rivers or Fountains, and of what life and diſpoſition the people inhabiting thereabouts are; if they be healthful, ſtrong &amp; wel coloured in their faces, without ſore eyes, or legs, ſuch bear witneſſe of the goodneſſe of their water, if contrary then it is nought. But if the water be new found out, ſo that this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience is wanting, there are other proofs.</p>
               <p>You muſt take a clean braſſe Baſon very well poliſhed, and caſt into it certain drops of the water, whereof you would make the experience, and after the water is dried, if the Baſon have no ſpots where the drops were, it is a ſign that the water is good.</p>
               <p>It is alſo a good proof to boil the water in the ſame Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and then let it cool and ſettle, and after it is poured out ſoftly, if there remain no gravel nor ſlime in the bottome, it is a ſign the water is good. And of two ſorts of water, that which is leaſt gravelly or ſlimy is the beſt.</p>
               <p>If in this veſſell or any other you boil peaſe, beans, or any other pulſe that makes pottage, that is the beſt water that boils them ſooneſt. You muſt alſo conſider, when you would make a certain experiment of waters, from what place they take their head, or original, whether it be ſandy, neat, and clear, or muddy, thick, &amp; foul, or whether there grow any ruſhes or any other unwholſome or naughty hearbs. But for more ſafety and ſure remedy, if you wil drink of an unknown water, or which is not reputed good, let it be boiled a little over a gentle fire, and let it cool again. <hi>Plinie</hi> ſaith, that the Emperour <hi>Nero</hi> boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his water ſo, and cooled it again in ſnow, and magnified himſelf that he had found out ſuch an invention. The reaſon why boiled water is more wholeſome than others is becauſe the water that we drink is not ſimple in its proper nature, but is mingled with earth and air; but by the fire the windi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is exhaled into vapour, the earthy parts by the nature of the fire, (which doth refine and ſeparate the divers natures)
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:175728:41"/>deſcends to the bottome and there reſts. By this means wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that is boiled becomes leſſe windie than raw water; becauſe the windy quality that it had at the firſt is evaporated, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo more ſubtile and light, being purified from the earthy parts, and ſo much more eaſie to be kept and preſerved, ſo that it cool again, and competently kept without much alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>And by this we may know, that Well-water is not ſo good as others; becauſe it participates more of the earth, and is not purified by the heat of the Sun; and therefore is more eaſie to corrupt; yet the more water is drawn out of a Well, the leſſe hurtfull it is, becauſe the continuall moving, hinders the accuſtomed corruption that faſtens to waters incloſed and have no courſe, and then nature ſends new and freſh water according to the meaſure that hath been drawn out. For this reaſon the waters of Lakes and ſtanding Pools is the worſt of all; becauſe for want of running, they corrupt and breed evill things, and many times infect the air, which breeds diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes to thoſe that live near them. We muſt again conſider, that thoſe waters which have their courſe towards the South, are not ſo good as thoſe which run towards the North; becauſe in the South parts the air is more mingled with vapours, and moiſture, which ſpoils the water and endamages it. And in the North parts, the air is more ſubtile and leſſe moiſt, whereby it ſwels not, nor is made ſo heavy.</p>
               <p>For this cauſe the water that is moſt clear, moſt light, moſt ſubtile, and moſt purified is the beſt, becauſe, as we have ſaid before, it is leſs mingled with other elements, and again, being ſet over the fire it heats ſooner then other water. So it is a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular triall between two ſorts of water, to ſee which will be firſt hot in the ſame quantity, by the ſame fire, and the ſame ſpace of time.</p>
               <p>And alſo to ſee which will be the fooneſt cold, for thoſe are two arguments of the penetrable and ſubtile ſubſtance: and forasmuch as the mingling of the earth among the water, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues the weight of it, it is good to chooſe the lighteſt, which may be done by this experiment.</p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:175728:42"/>
               <p>Take two pieces of linnen cloath, both of the ſame weight, and put one piece in one of the waters, and the other in the other water, and let them ſo remain till they be throughly wet, then take them out and ſpread them in the air, where the Sun comes not, and when they are dry weigh them again and that piece that weighs moſt ſhews that water to be the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieſt.</p>
               <p>Others weigh them in two neat glaſſe viols, both of a weight, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Plinie</hi> ſay, that the greateſt cauſe that diverſifies the quality of waters is, from the ſubſtance of the earth, from Stones, Trees, Minerall, and Mettals by which Fountains and Rivers paſſe, and this makes the one hot, the other cold; one ſweet, the other brackiſh. Wherefore it is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain rule, that that water which hath neither ſmach nor ſmell, is known to be the beſt.</p>
               <p>All thoſe that have writ of water maintain, that, that which paſteth through the Mines of gold is the beſt. And that thoſe Rivers are the moſt excellent in the world, whoſe fine ſands engender and preſerve gold.</p>
               <p>And now that we have ſpoken of Fountain and River, it is fit we ſhould ſpeak ſomething of rain water, which is praiſed by ſome, and cenſured by others. <hi>Vitruvis, Collumellus,</hi> and ſome other Phyſitians, give great praiſe of rain water, when it falis clear and neat; becauſe ſay they, it is light, and not blen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, for ſo much as it proceeds of vapour, which by its ſubtilty is mounted into the Region of the air, and it is to be believed, that the weighty and earthy part remains upon the earth. And although ſome ſay, that water that falls from the clouds corrupts preſently, as we ſee in ſtanding pools which ingend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers much impurity, yet we muſt not ſay it is the fault of the water, but that it is receaved in ſome place where either mud, or ſome other pollution is: and again by the means of that filth it carrieth along with it as it fals upon the ground when it rains aboundantly. Wherefore the cauſe of its ſuddain corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proceeds from that it is ſubtile and delicate, and by the heat of the Sun, and moiſture of the water, with the mixture of much filthineſſe. Yet if this water ſo ſubtile, purged, and clear,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:175728:42"/>were received falling from the tops of houſes that were clean, or at leaſt when it falls from the clouds through the air, before it touch any thing, and if it were ſo received in clean veſſels, it would be better than others, and would keep longer time. There are ſome of the contrary opinion, as <hi>Plinie,</hi> who ſaith it is ſo unwholſome that one ought not to drink it; becauſe the vapours from whence it iſſues, proceeds from many cauſes and places, whence it receives much different qualities, as well bad as good. And ſhewing yet further reaſons, he anſwers thoſe which we have before alledged, and ſaith that the triall is not ſufficient, to ſay therefore it is good, becauſe it is lighter, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawn out of the region of the air, for ſuch an evaporation is drawn on high by a ſecret violence of the Sun, and by the ſame reaſon that is alſo vapour whereof the ſtonie hardneſſe of hail is formed in the air, which water is pernitious, and likewiſe that of ſnow, he ſaith further: that beſides this defect, this rain water is made unwholſome by the vapour and heat of the earth, than when it Rains. And for an argument of its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity, we cannot but ſee how ſoon it will corrupt, whereof is made a true experience at Sea, where rain-water cannot be preſerved. For this cauſe we find fault with Wells and Ciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns.</p>
               <p>Upon all theſe opinions every one may give his own as he thinks good, as for me, I approve leſſe of rain-water then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, although it be more neceſſary, and that <hi>Plinie</hi> who finds fault with it ſaith, That Fiſhes grow fat in Pools, Lakes and Rivers, and that when it rains they grow better, and that they have need of rain-water. <hi>Theophraſtas</hi> ſaith, that Garden hearbs and all others, water them never ſo much, they grow not ſo well as with rain-water,</p>

And of a Lake that is amongſt the Troglodites which three times a day, and three times a night changeth its ſweet taſt into bitter, and the bitterneſſe into ſweet again.</p>
               <p>And alſo of a Brook in Judea, which every Sabboth day was dry, which is affirmed by <hi>Plinie.</hi> Writing again of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fountain which is in the Country of the Garamonts the which in the day time is ſweet, and ſo cold, that it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any one to drink of it. And in the night ſo hot, that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:175728:44"/>whoſoever puts his hand into it would be burned, and was called the Fountain of the Sun. Of this Fountain hath written for truth, <hi>Arian Diodoras,</hi> and <hi>Quintus Curſtus, Lucrecia</hi> the Poet gives the reaſon of it.</p>
               <p>It is a wonderfull thing of the Fountain of Eluſine, which is very clear, and ſtill, yet if any one ſound any inſtrument ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near it, it will fall a boiling that the water will leap above the brinks, as though it rejoiced at the ſound of the Muſick. This is certified by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his book of the wonders of nature by <hi>Solon,</hi> and the old Poet <hi>Ennius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vitruvius</hi> ſpeaks alſo of a River named Chimere, which water is very ſweet, nevertheleſſe, parting it ſelf into two ſtreams, the one is ſweet the other is bitter; wherefore it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that it draweth that bitterneſſe from the earth by which it paſſes, and therefore that ſeems no wonder. Albeit it be not eaſie to believe the divers qualities of other waters, whereof we have ſpoken before, let us not wonder any more when we ſhall know the reaſons.</p>
               <p>The ſame Authors make mention yet of another River na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Silar, which turns to ſtone, whatſoever branch or twig is thrown into it.</p>
               <p>In Illirica there is a Fountain of ſweet water, which burns any thing that is put into it. There is another in Epire, in which if you put a burning Torch it puts it out, and if you put it in unlighted, it will light it, and alwaies at midday it is dry, then when the day darkneth it begins to encreaſe again, that at midnight it will be ſo full that it runs over.</p>
               <p>In Perſia, they ſay there is a Fountain, which makes their teeth fall out that drinks of it.</p>
               <p>In Arcadia, there are certain Fountains, which run from ſome hils, which water is ſo cold, that there is no veſſel, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gold nor ſilver, nor any other mettal could hold it; for as far as they fill it it breaks in pieces, nor can be held in any other veſſel, but ſuch as are made of the hoof of a Mule. We will ſcarce believe that amongſt Rivers (although very great) there are ſome that run into the earth, and then riſe again, a good way off: if we would have examples, even Vadian in
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:175728:45"/>Spain. Tigris doth ſo likewiſe in Armenia, and Licus in Aſia.</p>
               <p>There are alſo Fountains of ſweet water, which entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea, keep above the ſalt water. Of which number there is one in Sicilie, and an Iſle named Enarie, upon the coaſt of Naples.</p>
               <p>We know wel that in Egypt it rains not: but that naturally the River Nilus overflows, and waters all the ground, leaving it moiſt, and fit to bring forth fruit.</p>
               <p>There are two Rivers in Beocia; In the one of which, all ſheep that are dipt, it makes their fleeces black, the other makes them white. In Arabia there is another Fountain, that makes all beaſts that drink of it, vermilion red: of all which waters that have theſe properties, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſpeaks copiouſly.</p>
               <p>The River Lynceſtis hath this quality, that it makes any that drinks of it drunk, as if it were wine. In the Iſland Cea, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Pliny,</hi> there is a fountain, which he that drinks of, becomes ſottiſh. There is a Lake in Thrace, which if any one drink of, or if they but bathe in it they die incontinent.</p>
               <p>There is alſo a River in Pontus, which brings forth a kind of Stones that burn; and when there is the leaſt wind, they light, and the more they are in the water the more they burn. They alſo write of divers waters which heal diſeaſes, whereof there is one in Italy, called Zize, which heals ſore eys. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Achaia, which if a woman great with child drink of, ſhe ſhall have a good delivery. Divers others alſo that heal other infirmities. As the Stone, the Leproſie, and the Tertian Ague, and the Quartan Ague whereof <hi>Therphraſtus Plinie</hi> and <hi>Vitruvius,</hi> ſpeaks. There is another River in Meſapoto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia, that ſends forth a ſweet odour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baptista Fulgoſa</hi> ſaith, in his collections, That in our time there was a Fountain in England, in which if you caſt in a piece of wood, in the ſpace of a year it would become Stone, Himſelf teſtifies, that which <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> ſpeaks of, which is, That there is a Fountain in high-Germany, and <hi>Albertus</hi> ſaith, that with his own hands he put a piece of wood into that water, which became perfect ſtone, and that part that touched not the water remained wood as before,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:175728:45"/>The ſame <hi>Fulgoſa,</hi> reports another property of a Fountain which is very ſtrange, for if a man walk about it, viewing of it, and looking into it, without ſpeaking any word, he ſhall find it clear and quiet; but if he ſpeak never ſo little when he is near, or going away from it, the water will be roubled and begin to bubble, he himſelf witneſſeth to have ſeen i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and to have tried the experience himſelf, for looking into the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain intentivery without ſpeaking, he ſaw it fair and clear. But when he ſpake the water was troubled and moved with ſuch force, as though one had been ſtirring in it with ſomething. In France there is one (as he writes) that is extream cold yet many times there is flames of fire ſeen to come out of it. <hi>Plinie</hi> ſaith that divers make a conſcience to join faith to theſe things. But they may be well perſwaded, that the great effects of nature ſhew themſelves more evidently in that element of water then in any other. Though the wonders are ſo many yet ought we not to think any one of them impoſſible, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe that are cerufied by ſuch Authors as I have alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged here.</p>
               <p>Again we are ſufficiently certified by the teſtimony of thoſe that have ſeen in our time, in an Iſland in the Canaries called For, in a place well inhabited with people which ſerve there ſelves with no other water but what they draw out of a Trough or Ciſtern, into which diſtils and drains abundantly the juyce of a Tree, which is in the middle of this Iſland, at the foot of which Tree nor any place near it; there is neither Fountain nor Prock, and nevertheleſſe, this Tree is alwaies ſo moiſt, that from its leaves, branches, and boughs, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter drops neceſſantly, and runs into this trough or ciſtern in ſo great abundance, that night and day they receive enough to ſerve for their neceſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ies throughout the Iſland, which we ſhould hardly believe if it were but onely put to writing. Therefore none ought to think ſtrange that which we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore recited; for this element of water is ſo powerfull, and ſo neceſſary that its forces and qualities are neverſtrange.</p>
               <p>As for the Sea, it is ſaid, it is more hot in winter than in Summer, and more ſalt in Autumn than at any other time.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:175728:46"/>And it is a thing of great wonder, that caſting oil into the Sea, appeaſeth the rage and fury thereof. Again, we know for certain, that it never ſnows in the places near about the Sea, that are far from firm land. Of all theſe things many give di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers reaſons, the greateſt part of which is attributed to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety and quality of the earth, and Mines whence Fountains ſpring, and Rivers runs through.</p>
               <p>That it is true, it is proved by that which we ſee daily, that Vines and other fruits of the earth, are better in one place than in another, becauſe in one place they are ſweet, and in another ſharp and ſower, the one good and profitable, the other da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mageable and hurtfull. The air it ſelf is corrupted and becomes peſtilential by paſſing through a naughty Country. What mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel is it then, if water which waſhes and penetrates the earth, ſtones, mettals, hearbs, roots, and trees, take their good or evil qualities, be they as ſtrange as may be, eſpecially being aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the force of the Planets and the Stars.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Paul Horatius</hi> and <hi>Eutropius,</hi> Secretaries to <hi>Octavian,</hi> and likewiſe <hi>Euſebius,</hi> ſay, That at the time that Jeſus Chriſt was born, it hapned in Rome, that in a publick Inne, was diſcovered and broke forth a Fountain of pure oil, which for the ſpace of a whole day inceſſantly iſſued out in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; and it ſeemed that ſuch a ſudden ſpring of oil would
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:175728:46"/>ſignifie the comming of Chriſt. That is to ſay, anointed, by which all Chriſtians are ſo. And the publick Inne in which all are indiſterently received and lodged, ſignifies our Mother Church the great Hoſtlery of Chriſtians, from whence ſhould iſſue and proceed inceſſantly all good people. <hi>Eutropius</hi> adds further. That in Rome, and adjacent places, at high noon, in a clear and fair day was ſeen a circle about the Sun, as ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and reſplendant as the Sun, which ſhewed as much brightneſſe or more than the Sun. <hi>Paul Horatius,</hi> writes alſo, that at the ſame time the Senate and people of Rome, offred to <hi>Octavus Augustus</hi> the title of Lord, which he refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and would not accept of, Prognoſticating (unknowing) that a greater Lord than he was upon the earth, to whom that title belonged. <hi>Commeſtor</hi> in his ſcholaſtick hiſtory affirms, That the ſame day, the Temple in Rome, dedicated by the Romans to the Goddeſſe <hi>Paix,</hi> fell to the earth ruined. And he ſaith, that from the time it was built by the Romans, they addreſſed to the Oracle of <hi>Apollo,</hi> to know how long time it ſhould endure? Who made them anſwer, even till a Virgin ſhould bring forth a child, which they judged impoſſible, and by that means their Temple ſhould laſt eternally, nevertheleſs, at the Virgins bearing a child (the King of heaven) it fell to the earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Luoas de Tuy,</hi> in his Chronicle of Spain, writes, that he hath found in ancient hiſtories of the Country (having conferred and computed the time) that the ſame night in which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our was born, there appeared in Spain at the hour of midnight, a cloud which gave ſo great light, that it ſeemed as midday.</p>
               <p>I remember alſo that I have read in St. <hi>Ierom.</hi> That when the Virgin fled with her ſon into Egypt, all the Idols and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages of the Gods which were there, tombled to the ground from above their Altars. And that the Oracles which heſe Gods (or to ſay better theſe Devils) gave them ceaſed, and never after gave them any anſwers.</p>
               <p>This miracle alledged by Saint <hi>Jerom,</hi> ſeems to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the excellent <hi>Plutarch,</hi> although he were a Pagan. Who not believing any thing of theſe things,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:175728:47"/>nor knowing wherefore they were come to paſſe, hath writ a particular Treatiſe of the defects of Oracles; for already in his time, which was a little after the death of Chriſt, men per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that ſuch Oracles were wanting. And in that Trea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe this thing was wonderfull, and truly worthy of great conſideration to ſee ſo apparently that the Devil ſhould demonſtrate himſelf incontinently beaten down and diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited, and that after the death of our Saviour he remained ſo vanqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſhed, that never ſince he could give an anſwer. And that the Gentiles without underſtanding the cauſe, had know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of this defect, by means whereof <hi>Plutarch</hi> writ this Treatiſe, in which are theſe words (whereof <hi>Euſebius</hi> makes mention, writing to <hi>Theodoras</hi> as a thing of note) I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſaith he, to have heard ſay, upon the death of the Demons, to <hi>Emilius</hi> the Orator, a prudent and an humble man. That his father comming one time by Sea towards Italy, and coaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by night an Iſland not inhabited, named Paraxis, as all in the ſhip were ſilent and at reſt, they heard a great and fearful voice which came from that Iſland. The which voice called <hi>Ataman</hi> who was the Pilot of the ſhip an Egyptian born. And although this voice was heard once or twice by <hi>Ataman</hi> and others, yet had they not the hardineſſe to anſwer till the third time, he anſwered. Who is there, who is it that cals me what would you have: Then the voice ſpake more high and loud and ſaid to him <hi>Ataman,</hi> I will that when you paſſe by near the Gulf called Laguna, you remember to cry aloud and m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ke them underſtand, that the great God <hi>Pan</hi> is dead. At which all that were in the ſhip were in great fear, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted all that the Pilot of the ſhip ſhould not mind it, nor ſpeak a word of it, nor ſtay in that Gulf, at leaſt if they could paſſe beyond it but go forward on their voyage: but comming to the place where the voice had deſigned them, the ſhip ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted, and the ſea was calm without wind; ſo that they could not ſail: by means whereof, they all concluded that <hi>Ataman</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:175728:47"/>ſhould do his Ambaſſage, and ſo he placed himſelf in the Poop of the ſhip, and cried as loud as he could, ſaying, I do make you know that the great <hi>Pan</hi> is dead. But as ſoon as he had ſpoke theſe words, they heard ſo many voices cry, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that all the air reſounded again, and this complaint laſted for a ſpace of time, ſo that thoſe in the ſhip being aſtonied, and having a proſperous wind followed on their courſe, and being arrived at Rome, told of this adventure, and what happened. Which being come to the ears of the Emperour, <hi>Tyberius</hi> would be truly informed, and found that it was truth; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is evident, that through all parts the Divels complained at the birth of our Saviour, becauſe it was their deſtruction. For by the ſupputation of time, we ſhall find that theſe things happened at the time that he ſuffered for us, or a little before then, when he chaſed and baniſhed them from the world. It is to be ſuppoſed that this great <hi>Pan</hi> (as to the reſtriction of great <hi>Pan</hi> God of the Shepheards) which they ſaid was dead, was ſome great Maſter Divel, which then loſt his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire and power as the others had.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe things <hi>Joſephus</hi> writes in thoſe very daies, there was heard in the Temple of Jeruſalem, a voice (though there was no living creature in the Temple) which ſaid, let us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon and go out of this Country ſpeedily, which was to ſay, they perceived the perſecution that they were to ſuffer, and that it drew near by the death of him who was the giver of life. In the Goſpel of the Nazarites it is found, that the day of the paſſion, that gate of the Temple fell, which was of a ſumptuous and perpetual ſtructure. Behold how we find theſe wonderfull things which happened in that time, though the Evangeliſts makes no mention of them, as things unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</p>
               <p>We muſt needs know that this great Eclipſe of the Sun, which laſted three hours, whileſt Chriſt was on the Croſſe, was not naturall, as that which we ſee ſometimes by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of the Sun and the Moon, the Moon being interpoſed between the Sun and the earth. And nevertheleſs, the Eclipſe which happened then at the paſſion was in oppoſition the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:175728:48"/>Moon being then at full, and diſtant from the Sun a hundred and eighty degrees in the other Hemiſphere, inferiour to the Town of Jeruſalem, to ſhew that it was true beyond that which Authors write.</p>
               <p>The Text of holy Scripture proves it, for it is certain that they never offered up the Lamb in ſacrifice, but upon the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day of the Moon. Which Lamb was eaten by Jeſus Chriſt and his diſciples, the day before his death. As it was commanded in <hi>Exodus</hi> the twelfth Chapter, and <hi>Leviticus</hi> the three and twentieth. The next day was the feaſt of unleven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed bread. Chriſt the immaculate Lamb was crucified, the Moon of neceſſity being at ful, and oppoſite to the Sun, which could not poſſibly make an Eclipſe, neither could any of the other Planets do it, therefore it was miraculous and contrary to the order of nature, and onely in the power of God who deprived the Sun of its light for that ſpace of time. By means whereof St. <hi>Denn is</hi> the Areopagite, being that day in Athens, and ſeeing the Sun ſo darkned, and alſo knowing as a man learned in Aſtrologie and the courſe of the heavens, that ſuch an Eclipſe muſt needs be contrary to the rule of nature, ſpake with a loud voice, ſaying, Either the world would end, or the God of nature ſuffer. For this cauſe ſaith one, that the Sages of Athens, being aſtonied hereat, cauſed an Alter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently to be built to the unknown God, ſince which time, St. <hi>Paul</hi> arriving there, declared unto them who was the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known God, which was Chriſt our Redeemer God and Man, which then had ſuffered, by means whereof he converted ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to the faith.</p>
               <p>Some have been in doubt to know of this Eclipſe and darkneſſe of the Sun, were univerſal through all the world, and grounded their argument upon that which the Evangeliſts ſaith over all the earth, which is to ſay, by a manner of ſpeaking, all the Country round about. And <hi>Origen</hi> was of this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But what? We ſee that in Greece, even at Athens, this tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſity was ſeen, which makes me believe that this Eclipſe was univerſal, over all our Hemiſphere, and over all where the Sun might be ſeen. I ſay ſo, becauſe over all the other
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:175728:48"/>Hemeſphere, where it was then night, it could not be ſeen, the ſight of the Sun for that time being not there, for it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not illuminate at one inſtant but one half of the earth, becauſe of the ſhadow it makes:</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs we ought to know, that the Moon being then at full, and having no light but what ſhe hath from the ſplendor of the Sun, and again being in the Hemeſphere, which is under us, ſhe came to be violently eclipſed and darken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by the onely cauſe; and for default of the light of the Sun, and ſo the darkneſs was univerſall over all the world, becauſe the Moon and the Stars can give no light unleſs they receive it firſt from the Sun.</p>

               <p>The world being thus divided in three opinions: thoſe which confeſſed Chriſt, did notable and marvellous things, whereof many bear witneſſe of their truth: of which number are St. <hi>Dennis, Tertullian, Lactantius, Firmian, Euſebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ns,</hi> and many others too long to recite.</p>
               <p>The other wicked ſort which perſecuted it as a ſtrange thing, and utterly diſagreeing to their law, did eagerly purſue totally to ruine it, and to hide the miracles, life, and doctrine of Chriſt. For this cauſe they ſpeak not of them, or thoſe among them which did ſpeak any thing of them, was but to make them contemned, and to cloud them, as did the wicked <hi>Porfice, Iulian, Vincent, Celſus, African, Lucian,</hi> and others, ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velliſh men. Againſt whom <hi>Ciprian, Origen,</hi> St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and others, have written learnedly.</p>
               <p>The other, which either for fear or worldly conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, refuſed to be Chriſtians, or to love and to know the truth, for the ſame reaſons; abandoned to ſpeak of it; and if ſome of them have touched any thing, it hath been with jeſts and lies, and that ſuccinctly enough. And nevertheleſſe, even as when one would hide the truth, under the vail of ſome colorable truth It often happens, by a certain hidden propriety in the truth, that he which would hide it diſguiſeth it, and palliates it, in ſuch ſort, that by his own drift or diſcourſe, he diſcovereth his lies, and the truth is diſcovered openly and manifeſtly. So it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this ſort to theſe two kind of people. For although they ſtrove to put to an end, and deſtroy the miracles and doctrine of Chriſt, yet every time they ſpake of them, they ſpake ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by which they diſcovered their malice, and the ſincerity of that doctrine.</p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:175728:49"/>
               <p>I could ſpeak of many things that the <hi>Sibils</hi> have ſaid and written; but becauſe that which they ſpake proceeded not from their own proper judgement, but from the ſpirit of propheſie, and as God had communicated it to them, although they were Heathens, I will leave them to come to other autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities.</p>
               <p>The firſt and moſt evident teſtimony, though it be the moſt common, is that of our greateſt enemies, in the number of which is <hi>Ioſephus,</hi> by linage and nation a Jew, and alſo by his life and profeſſion. He ſaith theſe words. [In theſe very times lived Jeſus, a very wiſe man, if it be lawful to call him man, becauſe in truth he doth marvellous things, and was maſter, and Tutor to them that loved him and ſought the truth. The Jews and Gentiles aſſembled unto him and followed him in great troups. And he was the Chriſt. And although he were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards accuſed by the principals of our faith, and crucified, yet was he not caſt off by them which had followed him before. And three days after his death he appeared alive unto them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Prophets inſpired by God, had foretold and propheſied of him. And yet in our time the doctrine and the name of Chriſtians, continues all the world over.] Theſe are the words of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> who writ of the deſtruction of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, as an eye-witneſſe, which hapned fourty years after the death of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pilate</hi> likewiſe, that gave the ſentence of death againſt him, nevertheleſſe bears witneſſe of his great miracles: ſending word of them by letters to the Emperour <hi>Tyberius,</hi> ſo that the Senate was put to ſit in Councell to adviſe, whether they ſhould receive Jeſus Chriſt for a God? and although they did not aſſent unto it, <hi>Tyberius</hi> forbad any further perſecuting the Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>As for the Earth-quake and the darkneſſe of the Sun, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time that Chriſt ſuffered upon the Croſſe, we have alſo Ethnicks for witneſſes. <hi>Flegon</hi> the Greek Hiſtoriogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher born in Aſia, of whom <hi>Suydas</hi> makes ſpeciall mention. That in the fourth year of the two hundred and tenth Olym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piade, which will meet being well accounted, with the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:175728:50"/>year of the Emperour <hi>Tiberius,</hi> which was then when our Saviour ſuffered. There was an eclipſe of the Sun, the greateſt that ever was ſeen or found in any Hiſtory: and that it endured from the ſixth to the ninth hour. And that during this eclipſe, the Earth-quake was ſo great in Aſia, and Bithi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, that there were an infinite number of houſes fell to the ground. It ſeems beſides, <hi>Flegon,</hi> who lived in thoſe times, and writ this, that <hi>Plinie</hi> vented and writ the ſame thing. For he ſaith, that in the time of the Emperour <hi>Tyberius,</hi> the Earth-quake was greater than ever was any before it: and ſaith, thereby was thrown to the earth and ruined twelve Towns in Aſia, beſides an infinite of other buildings. So that the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoriographers who were Gentiles, (although they knew not the cauſe) forbear not to write of the miracles of Chriſt. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miracle of the vail of the Temple which rent in ſunder <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſephus</hi> recites it alſo.</p>
               <p>Of the cruell death of the innocent children, which <hi>Herod</hi> cauſed to die, mention is made of it by another. Jew, named <hi>Filon</hi> a writer of great authority: In his abridgement of time; where he ſaith, that <hi>Herod</hi> cauſed many children to be put to death; and among them his own ſon: becauſe that he had heard that Chriſt a King, promiſed to the Hebrews, was born: and this Authour was in the times of the other <hi>Herod,</hi> called the Tetrark, as he himſelf ſaith.</p>

And that the Author of this name, was Chriſt of Jeruſalem, whom <hi>Pilate</hi> the Governour of Judea, had cauſed to be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, and by the means of his death his doctrine began to be extolled. But now let us ſee what ſome other Gentiles write that are not of leſſe authority.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plinie</hi> in ſome of his elegant Epiſtles, writes to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Trajan,</hi> whoſe Proconful he was in Aſia, to know how he would that he ſhould puniſh the Chriſtians, which were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed and brought before him: that he might give his Lord a good account of what he found againſt them. Amongſt other things he writes, that theſe Chriſtians roſe at certain hours in the night, and aſſembled themſelves together to ſing hymns and praiſes to Jeſus Chriſt, whom they worſhipped for God. And being aſſembled into a Congregation they made vows to do no evil or hurt to any; but promiſed not to ſteal, not to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterers, not to break their promiſes or vows, not to deny what hath been lent or given them to keep. And this <hi>Plinie</hi> ſaith further, that they eat altogether, without poſſeſſing any thing in proper.</p>
               <p>By this we may know what was then the exerciſe of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and for what the world hated them and perſecuted them. Theſe things were written by a Heathen and an Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſixty years after the Paſſion of our Saviour.</p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:175728:51"/>
               <p>To which letters the Emperour made anſwer, that ſeeing they were not accuſed for any exceſſe or other miſdeeds, that he ſhould not trouble himſelf to puniſh them, or make any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition againſt them. Yet nevertheleſſe, if they were accuſed and brought before him, that he ſhould find out a means to make them forſake their Religion; but if they would not leave it, yet he ſhould do nothing to them.</p>
               <p>Before this, it is true that this Emperour <hi>Traian,</hi> being a Heathen, and deceived by accuſers, had perſecuted the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. To which Empire afterwards ſucceeded <hi>Adrian</hi> his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, of whom <hi>Aelius Lampridius,</hi> a Heathen Hiſtoriagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, and an Idolater writes, that he began to honour the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, ſuffering them to live in their belief, and he himſelf worſhipped Chriſt with the others, and built Temples; but afterwards he changed his copy, and became hatefull, odious, and cruell towards the Chriſtians, being deceived and abuſed by the Maſters and their falſe ceremonies, and by the Biſhops of thoſe falſe Gods; telling him, that if he favoured the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, all the world would be converted to their belief; and they ſhould looſe the religion of their Gods. This is certified by <hi>Peter Criniff.</hi> It is found in the life of <hi>Saturninus,</hi> that to this Empeaour <hi>Adrian,</hi> there was a letter ſent by <hi>Severinus</hi> the Conſul, where he writes, that there was in Egypt divers Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, amongſt which ſome called themſelves Biſhops, and that none of them were idle, but that all of them did work, and employed themſelves in ſome action, and that there was not amongſt them, even thoſe that were blind and lame, that did not live by the labor of their hands, and that they all worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped one God, which was alſo worſhipped by the Jews.</p>
               <p>We alſo read in the Hiſtory of theſe times, that this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour beginning to perſecute the Chriſtians, by the perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their chief Biſhops, there was one of his Embaſſadors called <hi>Serene Eramy,</hi> an Ethnick like himſelf, which writ a letter unto him, in which he ſaid in his opinion, it was cruelty to oppreſs the Chriſtians, being accuſed for no other thing than obſerving their Religion, ſeeing that he found them not charged with any other crime or treſpaſſe.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O this Emperour <hi>Adrian,</hi> of whom we have ſpoken in the laſt Chapter, ſucceeded <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toninus Debonair,</hi> who although he had that name, was perverſe and wicked, he favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ill the belief of Chriſt, and perſecuted the Chriſtians. But his Succeſſour, <hi>Marcus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius,</hi> was more moderate to them; for inſtead of perſecuting them, he led them along with him in his army; by whoſe prayers he was delivered from the danger wherein he was for want of water, which his enemies had cut from him, becauſe he ſent them water, and to his enemies Thunder-bolts and Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Of theſe things are made mention in one of his leters, and <hi>Julius Capitoline</hi> alſo ſpeaks of it, although he doth not attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute it all to the Chriſtians, Theſe hapned about the forty and five years after the Paſſion of our Saviour. The fifteenth or twentieth year following, <hi>Severus</hi> being choſen Emperor, <hi>Elius Spartine</hi> an Ethnick like himſelf (writ that he ſhould make a law) by which he ſhould forbid upon pain of great puniſhment that none ſhould turn Chriſtian nor Jew. After which <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus, Antoninus Heliogabolus</hi> was Emperor, who as <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pridius</hi> recites, that writ his life, cauſed a Temple to be built in Rome, dedicated to his God onely, to which he would have the Chriſtians reſort to perform their ſacrifices, which the Chriſtians would not do. After this <hi>Heliogabolus,</hi> ſucceeded the Emperour <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> in the year of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:175728:52"/>one hundred ninety two; and was in great doubt, whether or no he ſhould become a Chriſtian. Alſo we find by the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory that is written of him, that he had a good opinion of that belief, and that he much eſteemed of the Chriſtians, and gave them places, and plots for buildings, in Rome, to make their Temples and places for prayer. He kept the picture of our Saviour in his cloſſet. This is written by <hi>Elius Lampridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> beſides what the Chriſtians write. And he ſaith further, that divers Victuallers and Paſtry-Cooks, went to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour with a complaint againſt the Chriſtians, that they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away their harbours and their houſes, to make places for their ſuperſtitious hypocriſie, and that they obſerved a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on contrary to that of the Romans. To which complaint the Emperour made anſwer, that he had rather God ſhould be worſhipped in thoſe places, than to imploy them in the affairs of their vocations.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Severus</hi> being dead, <hi>Maximinian</hi> ſucceeded him, an enemy and perſecutor of the Chriſtians; but he lived not long, and died an ill death.</p>
               <p>Since whom and two others more, which lived but a ſhort while, the Empire fell into the hands of <hi>Philip,</hi> who was baptized as ſome ſay, and was the firſt that received the Chriſtians, <hi>Euſebius</hi> affirmeth it; yet the Heathen Hiſtorio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers, write nothing of it.</p>
               <p>Every day God enlightned more and more the hearts of men, and a great number were converted to the Chriſtian faith in ſpight of <hi>Decius</hi> and <hi>Diocleſian</hi> and others ſuch like, and even till they being weary of perſecuting them, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nived at them, and ſuffered them for a time, as appears clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by a letter of <hi>Maximinian</hi> the Emperour, a companion to <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> which was two hundred years after our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.

               <p>
                  <hi>Caeſar Maximinian</hi> invincible great Biſhop of Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, Egypt, Thebes, Sarmacia, Perſia, Armenia, and victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious over the Medes, and for his victories named nineteen times Emperour, and eight times Conſul, and father of his Country. At the beginning of our Empire. Amongſt other
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:175728:52"/>things which we determined to do for the publick good, we do ordain, that the order which was kept in all things, ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by our ancient Laws, be conſerved and kept. And for the ſame reaſon we command, that thoſe men which call themſelves Chriſtians, and have forſaken our ancient Religion, be preſſed, conſtrained, and forced to forſake the new Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which they have taken up; and that they obſerve our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Religion, eſtabliſhed by our predeceſſors. But being it is come to our knowledge, notwithſtanding this commandment, and rigour uſed againſt them to make them obſerve it, they have not left to follow their own wils; and are ſo firm, and conſtant to their purpoſes, that there is neither force nor pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment ſo grievous which can make them draw back from their Religion, or make them obſerve ours; but will rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves to grievous torments, and death it ſelf; and that they are ſtill at this day in the ſame conſtancie, and will not reverence or worſhip any of the gods in Rome; our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten remembring of our accuſtomed clemencie and pity, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to be uſed towards the Chriſtians, for that cauſe we do from hence-forward permit and ſuffer, that all perſons may make and call themſelves Chriſtians, have places for their meetings, and build themſelves Temples, where they may pray and ſacrifice: Which licence and leave we grant unto them, upon condition they ſhall not do any thing contrary to our Common-wealth and Religion: and that in other things they ſhall obſerve our Laws and Conſtitutions; and that in acknowledgement of this permiſſion, they ſhall be bound to pray to their God for our life, and health, and alſo for the eſtate of the Common-wealth of Rome, that the Town be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proſperous and entire, they themſelves may live of their labour in reſt and ſafety. O truly unfortunate Emperour! if thou ſhouldeſt force the Chriſtians to leave and renounce their Faith as wicked, how wouldeſt thou have them pray for thee, and force them to have remembrance of thee in their prayers. At the leaſt this Letter will ſerve us, in that thou thy ſelf doeſt teſtifie of the Conſtancy, Virtue, and Spirit, that the Martyrs, and holy Chriſtians had, in ſuffering patiently,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:175728:53"/>for a long ſpace of time, the torment, and puniſhments, that were inflicted upon them for the love of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now ſometime after <hi>Maximinian,</hi> there came to ſucceed in the Empire <hi>Constantine,</hi> which was ſurnamed The great, ſon of that good Dame <hi>Hellen,</hi> which found the true croſſe, which was about two hundred and ninety years after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Mankind.

He ſuffered all indifferently to become Chriſtians, for whom he built ſumptuous Temples, and thoſe which had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly dedicated to Idols, he dedicated to the ſervice of Chriſt, and his members. Since which time, although the Church of God hath ſuffered ſcandals and perſecutions, as thoſe of <hi>Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> the Apoſtata; and others, yet alwaies, and in many places of the world, Chriſt hath been publickly worſhipped and from thence forward, all hiſtories are full of the acts of the Saints: and the greateſt part of the ſubſequent Emperours, have been faithfull Catholicks, as <hi>Theodoſius, Iuſtinian</hi> and others.

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:175728:53"/>the reader would receive little pleaſure. Howſoever we will ſpeak of the love and enmity which is between many things, that none knoweth truly from whence the cauſe proceeds, which in truth is a thing very wonderfull, as that which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the dog and the cat, between oyl and glew, between the ſtag and the adder, and ſuch like, whereof we will ſpeak that naturally hate one another, and yet this enmity proceeds not from the elements, for the contrariety and enmity which are between things of which they are compoſed, is moſt clear; as we ſee, that water is an enemy to fire, becauſe the fire is hot and dry, and the water cold and moiſt, in ſuch ſort that theſe elements are totally contraries. The water and the earth are friends in as much as they are both cold, but they are contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in this, that the water is moiſt, and the earth dry. Betwixt the fire and the earth there is ſome conformity, becauſe of the drineſſe of them both, and difference by the heat of the fire, and the cold of the earth. So betwixt the elements there is a contrariety, and yet in part of them there is ſome conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. All things then being compoſed of the elements, it muſt of neceſſity follow, that amongſt them muſt be theſe contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions and conformities which the elements have, whereof they are compoſed. Wherefore that thing in which the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menrary quality moſt governs, takes the name from that qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and that do we call hot or cold moiſt or drie, ſome in a more high degree than others, according as the thing is qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, with one of theſe firſt four qualities. And ſo it comes to paſſe that one thing is contrary to another cauſing divers effects, which contradiction is moſt manifeſt, and we know it ſo ſure, that now we will come to give the reaſons.</p>
               <p>But of this other enmity which proceeds not from the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but from a ſecret or hidden propriety or ſuperiour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, requires a deep contemplation to ſearch out from whence the cauſe proceeds.</p>
               <p>The dog and the cat (as we have ſaid before) would do one another miſchief, and yet we know not wherefore, we ſee alſo other things that agree and love one another, and yet this love is not derived from the elements whereof they are compoſed.</p>

               <p>This is not of the leaſt conſideration, that it is amongſt men as among beaſts, ſeeing that, not kowing wherefore, nor how one man that ſeeth another at the firſt ſight, that never ſaw or knew one another before, will contemn and loath him, and another will be agreeable and pleaſing unto him, and ſometimes ſo ſoon as he ſhall ſee one he knoweth not, he will bear him affection and reverence him, although he be below him. Others will be diſpiſed, although they be great perſons, yea Lords. There are others to be found, that ſeem as though they were born to be Tutors and inſtructers to other, as you may ſee two men, whereof the one will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer himſelf to be led and governed by the other, and in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times the Lord by his ſervant, in ſuch ſort, as it ſeemeth he were naturally ſubject unto him, and we can give no reaſon for it.</p>
               <p>In like caſe we ſee ſuch ſubjection and enmity amongſt beaſts, as between the Eagle and the Swan, between the Raven and the Kite, and many times we ſee that the Kite ſnatches the prey out of the Ravens claws.

               <p>The Stag perſecutes the Adder, for with a ſtrong reſpiration of his breath, which he makes at the mouth of the Adders hole he draws him out of his hole and eats him. That it is true that there is ſuch an enmity between them, you may prove it by burning ſome of the Stags hair, for all the Adders wil fly from the ſmoak of it. There is alſo great enmity betwixt the Raven, the Aſſe, and the Bull, becauſe the Raven attempts alwaies with his beak to ſtrike out their eyes. The greateſt enemies to the Wolf, are the Fox, the Aſſe, and the Bull.</p>
               <p>There is alſo a naturall quarrell betwixt the Vulture and the Eel, The Lyon is afraid and ſhuns the houſe Cock, alſo
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:175728:54"/>the fire, and the noiſe of a Waggon. The Hienna is an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the Panther. The Scorpion hath a deadly hatred to the Tarantola, whoſe biting or ſting cannot be healed (as it is ſaid) but by muſick, and there is ſo much enmity between theſe two beaſts, that he that is ſtricken with the Scorpion is healed with the oil wherein Terantolaes have been ſteeped and ſuffocated. The Elephant which is one of the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt beaſts, fears and ſhuns a Snake or an Adder, and alſo a Sheep, and is amazed at the gtunting of a hog. There is a kind of Faulcon which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calleth Tico, that hath a great war and debate alwaies againſt the Fox, and as often as he can, beats and perſecutes him. <hi>Elian</hi> writes that there is a great enmity between the Raven, and a kind of Falcon called Pelagre, and between the Raven and the Turtle-Dove. There is alſo a deadly hatred between the Owl and the Stork, the Patridge and the Tortis. The Pellican perſecutes the Quail, above all other birds. And the Horſe is afraid more of a Camel then of any other beaſt. There is alſo great diſcord and enmity amongſt fiſhes. The Dolphin is an enemy to the Whale. The Cougar is naturally an enemy to the Lampry.</p>
               <p>The Adder if he ſeeth a man cloathed, he will hurt him if he can, and hath the boldneſſe to venter at him, but if he ſee him naked he flieth from him. The Rats and the Snakes, or Adders, are great enemies, and when they cover their eggs in winter, and that they go not out, the Rats perſecute them and make war againſt them, and the Snake which by inſtinct of nature knowes it, makes proviſion for the Rats to feed on, that ſo they may be buſied and leave them. The Rat is ſo afraid of Beech-maſt, that if you ſhould put never ſo little into the curds that make cheeſe the Rat will never eat of it.</p>
               <p>A Sheep doth ſo naturally hate a Wolf, that if one make a drum with the skin of a Wolf, the Sheep will flie from the ſound of it, as if it were from a living Wolf. There are ſome alſo that ſay, if you ſhould make Lute or Viol-ſtrings of the guts of a Wolf, and of a Sheep, and ſtring the inſtruments therewith, you ſhould never make them agree nor make good harmony. The Monky ſhuns the Tortiſe and Craw-fiſh.</p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:175728:55"/>
               <p>The Rat, by a ſecret property is ſo contrary to the Scorpion, that the biting of a Scorpion is healed by putting upon it a Rat. The Snake and the viper fears naturally the Crab, which hath ſuch force over theſe kind of creatures, that if a Hog be bitten by a Viper, he is healed by eating a Crab-fiſh. And which is more ſtrange, when the ſun is in the ſign of <hi>Cancer,</hi> thoſe ſerpents ſuffer pain. The Scorpion fiſh and Crocodile, are continually at war, and kill one another. The Panther fears the Once and in ſuch ſort, that he will let it kill him without reſiſtance; and if the skin of a Panther, be hung near the skin of an Once, that of the Panther will ſhed all the hair and conſume. The enmity is ſo much, betwixt the Crow and the Owl, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſaith, they will rob one another of their eggs. The Waſp makes war ordinarily againſt the Spider.

The Mole is ſo horribly afraid of the Ant, tha ſhe ſhuns the Tree where they are. The Spider hath war with the Snake, and <hi>Plinie</hi> ſaith will kill it, when the Spider ſees the Snake ſleep under the Tree where ſhe is, ſhe lets her ſelf down by a thred that ſhe makes, and then gets into the head of the Snake, where ſhe bites, and ſo faſtens her ſelf, that ſhe will not forſake him till ſhe hath killed him with her ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome.</p>
               <p>There is alſo amongſt other inanimate things, a naturall contradiction, and enmity. For oil is an enemy to glew, oil is an enemy to water, ſo is lime; but the oil and the lime a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree together and join naturally.</p>
               <p>The Olive hath a naturall property againſt the luxurious and fleſhly given, ſo that if an unchaſt woman plant them they die, and take no root.</p>

               <p>We might bring ſo many examples of theſe naturall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, which are between things animate and inanimate, that it might be brought to a great length, and likewiſe of things that love one another. As the Pehens love the company of the Pigeons. The Turtle the Popengay.

The Fox agrees-well enough with the Snake; and the Sheep are not in danger among them. The Sea-Mole is ſo beloved of the Whale, that <hi>Plinie</hi> ſaith, it goeth ſwimming before the Whale to warn him of ditches and holes.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee the marvellous works of nature, diſpoſed by order and the will of God, by the influence of the Stars and Planets.

               <argument>
                  <p>Of ſome properties of the Viper, and how the fleſh of it may be ſafely eaten.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Viper is a kind of a ſerpent wel enough known to many, and although it be but little, yet it is vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous enough, for with a little prick it will kill a man. But as the Lord hath made nothing in vain without ſome profit, ſo this beaſt with all his venome, ſerves man to cure ſome diſeaſes, and for Medicine, principally for
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:175728:56"/>the pain in the throat, it is good by a ſecret property by carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about one the head of a Viper, ſo that alive it killeth, and dead it healeth. The Theriacle is proper againſt venome, and in making that Compoſition there goeth ſome of this beaſt (for elſe it is not perfect) that it may have the greater efficacie, and therefore it is called Theriacle, becauſe <hi>Thirion</hi> in Greek, ſignifieth a Viper or a venemous beaſt. It is true, that ſome give another Etimologie and reaſon of that name. But before we ſpeak of the profits that come by the Viper, let us hear what <hi>Plinie, Iſiodorus,</hi> and <hi>Elian</hi> ſay of it.</p>
               <p>They ſay that when the beaſt engendereth, the Male puts his head in the mouth of the Female, whereby ſhe receiveth ſuch pleaſure that with her ſharp teeth, ſhe wrings and cuts off his head, ſo ſhe remains widdow-like and bagged with young, which comes to be eggs, which are formed in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; of which egs comes Vipers in a convenient time, by caſting every day one, to twenty, and becauſe they are ſo many, thoſe which remain behind, cannot ſtay the time of their delivery, but break the belly of their mother, ſo that by her death they are born and live.</p>
               <p>If it be ſo it is a wonderfull thing, for it ſeemeth the child revengeth the death of the Father. With this opinion of <hi>Plinie,</hi> divers others agree, yet there are many that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict it, and deny that the Viper dieth in her bringing forth her young ones; in which opinion. I reſt my ſelf, becauſe the other doth not ſeem naturall, neither have I ever ſeen the experience, nor know not any one that ſay they have ſeen it. <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> in the life of <hi>Apollo Trijan</hi> brings in <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi> who recites to have ſeen a Viper, that after ſhe had brought forth her young ones, licked them, and was well. One may gather as much out of the words of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> which ſaith. The Viper onely amongſt other Serpents, makes her young ones; for firſt ſhe forms them in her body of egs, as fiſhes ſpawn, then having formed them they remain three days wrapped up in a tender th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> skin, which in due time breaks and ſets the little ones at liberty: becauſe of which <hi>Apuleus</hi> in his apologie, calls them <hi>Oviperes,</hi> and not Vipers; that is bred
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:175728:56"/>of egs. And many times it comes to paſſe, that this tender skin, breaking in the belly of the Viper, they come forth eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day one, even to the number of above twenty, theſe are the words of <hi>Aristotle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In another place, in the third book of beaſts, he ſaith, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the bringing forth of Serpents. The Viper before ſhe brings forth little ones, forms the egs within her. And I think from thence proceeds this opinion, who ſay that the little ones eat themſelves out of the belly of the Viper. For it hath ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them which maintain it, that when <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſpoke of this firſt coming forth, they would have it, that they brake, and gnawed the belly of the Viper.</p>
               <p>Now leaving this diſcourſe, I ſay the Viper, as venemous as ſhe is, gives ſuccour and help to man. <hi>Diaſcorides</hi> ſaith, that the fleſh of a Viper ſodden or dreſſed, may be eaten ſafely, and that it is very medicinable for the Nerves and for the fight.</p>
               <p>And to dreſs him to eat, you muſt cut off the head &amp; the tail, then the skin being taken off and well prepared, boil him in oil and wine with good ſtore of Aniſeeds. He ſaith alſo that of this fleſh is made a kind of ſalt or pouder, which gives a good appetite, and is prepared in this manner,</p>
               <p>Take a new earthen pot, and put the fleſh of the Viper in it dreſſed as before, then put in ſalt and figs ſtamped with a competent quantity of Hony, and the pot being well covered, ſet it to bake a long time in an oven, till it may be beaten and brought to a powder. And whoſoever afterwards would uſe it with other meats, will find it very profitable and ſavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul Egenetta</hi> ſaith, that the fleſh of the Viper is ſingular good for Lepers and Lazers, and for that purpoſe eſteems much of the ſalt foreſpoken of. <hi>Plinie</hi> ſaith there is a certain nation in the Indies, that eat Vipers. <hi>Diaſcorides</hi> ſaith alſo, that thoſe that uſe to eat of the fleſh of Vipers, live long and in health.</p>
               <p>Againſt the biting of this beaſt there are many reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:175728:57"/>But <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> names one, ſaying, that to him which is bit with a Viper, melodie and muſick help much. <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, that the beaſt eats not all the time of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that ſhe keeps her ſelf (as dead) hid in the earth, and then if you find her, touch her, or handle her, ſhe bites not, and when Summer comes ſhe recovers her force again. So much <hi>Plinie</hi> reports of Liſards Snakes, and all other ſorts of creeping Serpents. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, they keep themſelves ſo hidden in the earth three or four moneths without eating any thing. <hi>Elian</hi> ſaith, that the Vipers which breed in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Arabia, although they bite, their teeth are not vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous; becauſe they eat Baum, and lie under the ſhade of it. And <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, they are very deſirous to drink wine, and that many people take them by putting veſſels of wine in places where they haunt, and ſo they make themſelves drunk, then they take them ſleeping. There are other things to be ſaid of the quality and property of the Viper, which I leave for brevities ſake.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> is a kind of Spider which thoſe of that country call Tatantola, and ſome Phalange, which in the beginning of Summer are ſo vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous that whoſoever is bitten of them, if he have not help preſently he looſes his ſences and dies, and if any eſcape death,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:175728:57"/>they are ſenceleſſe, and totally not themſelves. For which evil, experience hath a remedie, which is muſick, that which theſe Authors ſay, is as a teſtimony of their own experience, as eye-witneſſes, who ſay, that as ſoon as any one is bitten, they ſend preſently for one that can play upon the Vian or Flute, or ſome other inſtrument, which play and ſing divers leſſons, which being heard by him that is ſtrucken by the venemous Spider, he begins to dance and ſtir as if all his life time he had been accuſtomed to dancing, in which ſury and force of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing he continues till the venome be diſſipated and waſted. And this <hi>Alexander</hi> ſaies that he hath ſeen, that one that hath been wounded with this beaſt, hath continued ſo long in dancing, till the Muſitians have been all weary and ceaſed, and the poor dancer fall to the ground as dead, having loſt his ſtrength, but as ſoon as they began to play again, he ſaw the poor ſick man, raiſe himſelf anew, and begin to dance with as much force as before, even untill the wound was entirely cured.</p>
               <p>He ſaith yet further, that if it happen that one that had not been well cured by Muſick, a ſhort time after hearing inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Muſick, began to ſtir their feet and were forced to dance, even till they were cured, which truly is wonderfull in nature.</p>
               <p>A <hi>ſclepiades</hi> writes, that ſinging and a ſoft ſound of muſick is a great help to thoſe that are Frantick. We read alſo that <hi>Eſmineas</hi> the Thebean, hath cured divers diſeaſes and mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies by a ſweet ſoft noiſe of Flutes. <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> and <hi>Aulus Gelius</hi> ſay, that muſick appeaſeth the pain of the Sciatica and the Gout.</p>
               <p>Again, we find in the holy Scripture that <hi>David</hi> with mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick caſt out the evill ſpirit out of <hi>Saul.</hi> Such is the great effect that proceeds from the cauſe of the great amity that the nature of man bears to muſick. And if we well conſider, we ſhal not find it ſtrange, that divers infirmities are cured by the means of muſick, forasmuch as we ſee that there are ſome beaſts that kill laughing others weeping, and others ſleeping.

               <argument>
                  <p>Of a strange medicine; wherewith <hi>Fauſtina</hi> was cured of diſhoneſt love. And of divers other remedies againſt that paſſion.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THat the affection and priſon of the mind, which is ordinarily called Love, is a ſtrong paſſion and of great effect in the ſoul; let us ask of ſuch men, which by experience have known it, and of ſuch of whom examples are notorious, namely of very excellent perſonages, that have ſuffered their wills to have been tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported even ſo far, that ſome of them have died. <hi>Jules Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitolin,</hi> amongſt other examples, recites that which happened to <hi>Faustina</hi> daughter to <hi>Antoninns,</hi> and wife to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> who fell in love with a Maſter of Fence or Gladiator, in ſuch ſort, that for the deſire which ſhe had of his company, ſhe was in danger of death ſhe did ſo conſume away. Which being underſtood by <hi>Marcus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius,</hi> he preſently called together a great companie of Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logians and Doctours, to have counſel and find remedy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon. At laſt it was concluded, that the Fencer ſhould be kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and that they ſhould unknown to her, give <hi>Fauſtina</hi> of his bloud to drink, and that after ſhe had drank it the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour her husband ſhould lie with her. This remedie wrought marvellouſly, for it put this affection ſo far from her, that ſhe never afterwards thought of him. And the hiſtorie ſaith, of this Copulation, that the Emperor had then with her, was begotten <hi>Antoninus Commodus;</hi> which became ſo bloudy and cruel, that he reſembled more the Fencer, whoſe bloud his mother had drank at the conception of him, than <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> whoſe ſon he was: which <hi>Commodus</hi> was alwaies found amongſt the Gladiators, as <hi>Eutropius</hi> witneſſes in the life of the ſame <hi>Commodus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Greek and Arabick Phyſitians, place this diſeaſe of love, amongſt the grievous infirmities of the body of man, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:175728:58"/>thereupon preſcribe divers remedies. <hi>Cadmus Mileſien,</hi> as <hi>Suydas</hi> reports in his collections, writes a whole book, treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the particular remedies to hunt out this diſeaſe of Love, Amongſt other remedies which Phyſitians give for this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe, one is, That to him that is paſſionate in Love, one ſhould put into his hands great affairs, importuning his credit, and his profit; that his Spirit being occupied in divers matters, it may draw away his imagination from that which troubles him: and they ſay further, that they ſhould ſuffer him to be merry and converſant with other women.</p>
               <p>Againſt this heat, <hi>Plinie</hi> ſaith, it is good to take the duſt upon which a mule hath tumbled, and caſt it upon the Lover, and all to be powder him; or elſe of the ſweat of a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed mule, as <hi>Cardanus</hi> affirms in his book of Subtilties.</p>
               <p>The Phyſitians alſo teach how to know what perſon is loved of him that is ſick in Love; and it is by the ſame Rule that <hi>Eriſtratus,</hi> Phyfitian to King <hi>Seleucus,</hi> knew the love that <hi>Antiochus</hi> bare to the Queen <hi>Stratonicus</hi> his Step mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for he being extream ſick, and would rather die than diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the cauſe of his ſickneſs, proceeding from love which he bare to his fathers wife. She came into the chamber, juſt then when the Phyſitian was feeling the Patients pulſe, which beat ſo ſtrong when he ſaw the Queen come into the chamber, that <hi>Eristratus</hi> knew that he was in love with her, and that was the cauſe of his ſickneſs: wherefore he found the way to make the King acquainted with it, by ſuch a means as would be too tedious to recite. Which being experimented by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſeeing his ſon in danger, if he did not prevent it, thought it good (though contrary to the intention of the ſon, which choſe rather death than to be healed by his fathers Ioſs) to deprive himſelf of his Queen, and give her to his ſick ſon. And ſo indeed, the age, and the beauty of the Lady, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe marriage, was more proper for the ſon than for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And by this means, <hi>Antiochus</hi> lived well and gallantly many years with his wel-beloved <hi>Stratonicus.</hi> The Hiſtory is very neatly recited by <hi>Plutark</hi> in the life of <hi>Demetrius.</hi> And thus you ſee why Phyſitians ſay, that you muſt feel the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:175728:59"/>Pulſe of thoſe that are in love, and repeat to them divers names of perſons, and if you name the right the pulſe will beat thick and ſtrong and by that you ſhall know whom they love. By divers other ſigns one may know when any is in love, and with whom, which I leave to ſpeak of now.</p>

                  <p>Of the ſtrange and furious love of a young At henian. And of the ridiculous love of King <hi>Xerxes.</hi> And how beaſts have many times loved men and women.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>TO ſee men affectioned to women and women to men is a naturall thing and to be believed. But here blindneſſe is come to that height, that that which I intend to ſpeak of, ſeems impoſſible and incredible. Hiſtoriographers write it for truth that in the Town of Achens there was a young man, of an honeſt family, competeutly rich and well known, who having curiouſly obſerved a Statue of Marble, excellently wrought, and in a publick place in Athens fell ſo in love with it, that he could not keep himſelf from the place where it ſtood, but be alwaies embracing of it, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies when he was not with it, he was diſcontented, and blub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd with tears.</p>
               <p>This paſſion came to ſuch an extremity, that he addreſſed himſelf to the Senate at Athens, and offering them a good ſum of money, beſeeching them to do him the favour that he might have it home with him. The Senate found that they could not by their authority, ſuffer it to be taken away, nor to ſell any publick Statue, ſo that his requeſt was denied, which made him marvellous ſorrowfull even at the heart. Then he went to the Statue, and put a Crown of Gold upon it, and enriched it with garments, and Jewels of great price, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored it, and ſeriouſly beheld it, muſing alwaies upon it, and in this folly perſevered many daies, that at laſt being forbidden
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:175728:59"/>theſe things by the Senate, he killed himſelf with grief; this thing was truly wonderfull. But if that be true which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon <hi>Xerxes,</hi> and affirmed by ſo many Authours, indeed he excelled in folly all the men in the world. They ſay he fell in love with a Plain tree, a tree well known though a ſtranger in England, and that he loved it, and cheriſhed it, as if it had been a woman.</p>
               <p>Seeing then theſe things happen to rationall men, we may believe that which is written of bruit beaſts, which have loved certain men and women, eſpecially when we find it certified by great and famous writers. As <hi>Glaucus:</hi> that was ſo loved of a ſheep that it never forſook him. Every one holds that the Dolphin is a lover of men. <hi>Elian</hi> writes in his book of beaſts a caſe worthy to be read. He ſaith, that a Dolphin ſeeing upon the Sea-ſhore, where children were a playing, one among the reſt which he liked very well, he fell ſo in love with it, that every time that the Dolphin ſee him, he came as near as he could to the edge of the water to ſhew himſelf. At the firſt the child being afraid, did ſhun it, but afterwards, by the Dolphins perſeverance one day after another, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſigns of love to the child, the child was encouraged, and upon the kind uſage of the Dolphin, the child was embold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to ſwim upon the water near unto the fiſh even to go ride upon the back of it, and the fiſh would carry him for a good ſpace of time even to the bottome of the water, till the child made a ſign to riſe again.</p>
               <p>In this ſolace and ſport they ſpent many daies, during which the Dolphin came every day to preſent himſelf to the brink of the Sea. But at one time, the child being naked, ſwimming in the Sea, and getting upon the Dolphin willing to hold faſt, one of the ſharp pricks in the Fin of the Dolphin run into his bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which wounded him ſo that the child died immediately in the water, which the Dolphin perceiving and ſeeing the bloud and the child dead upon his back, he ſwam preſently to the ſhore, and as though he would puniſh himſelf for this fault, ſwimming in great fury he leaped out of the water, carrying with him as well as he could the dead child, which he ſo much loved, and died upon the ſhore with him.</p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:175728:60"/>
               <p>This very thing is recited by <hi>Plinie,</hi> and others with exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Dolphins which have born love to men. And par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly he ſaith, that in the time of the Emperour <hi>Octavian,</hi> another Dolphin, in the ſame manner, took love to a child up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sea-coaſt near to Puſoll, and that every time this child called <hi>Simon</hi> (they ſay this fiſh will run at that name) it came preſently to the Sea brink, &amp; the child mounted upon the back of it, and the Child was carried into the ſea as little away as he would and brought back again ſafe He ſaith alſo that this child dying by accident of ſickneſſe, and the Dolphin coming divers times to the accuſtomed place, not finding the child there, died alſo. <hi>Plinie</hi> the ſecond, Nephew to the great <hi>Plinie,</hi> recites marvellous things of the Dolphin in his ninth book of his Epiſtles, in an Epiſtle which begins thus,</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Why Snow being covered with ſtraw, it preſerves it in its coldneſſe, and hot water in its heat, ſeeing they are two contrary effects by one and the ſame thing, with ſome other ſecrets.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>TO men of wit, and lovers of the contemplation of the works of nature, there ſhall not any thing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it ſelf though never ſo ſlight, or of little worth, but they will find ſomething of note in it, which may yield them content when they have found it out. We may find many men, that if we ſhould ask them the reaſon, and what is the cauſe that Snow being covered with ſtraw is preſerved a long time in its cold nature of Snow with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out melting, they could not tell what to ſay. To this <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Aphrodiſe,</hi> an excellent Parepatetick, anſwers; That ſtraw hath no manifeſt or known quality, it is neither hot nor cold, ſo that ſome have named it without any quality, for this cauſe, becauſe it is ſo ſingularly temperate, and delicate, even to ſuch a degree, as we cannot ſay whether it be hot or cold,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:175728:60"/>and ſo eaſily converts it ſelf unto the qualitie of the thing whereunto it is adjoined; ſo that putting it upon ſnow, which is cold, the ſtraw pertakes of the cold quality of it, and by the means thereof aids and maintains the coldneſſe of the Snow, as a thing of one quality helped by another, without heating it at all, becauſe it hath none; ſo the Snow being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with cold, and defended from heat, which the ſtraw keeps from it, preſerves it ſelf in the ſame being, a long time, and longer than if it were not covered with ſtraw.</p>
               <p>By the ſame reaſon it works a contrary effect in warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, becauſe being covered with ſtraw, the ſtraw receiveth immediately, the quality of heat from the water, and being ſo heat, it aids and keeps the water in its heat, and defends and keeps away the air that would cool it.</p>
               <p>By this reaſon we may underſtand and find out other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and doubts, which curious perſons may put unto us like unto this.</p>
               <p>We know well, that beſides our naturall and inward heat, that which cauſeth heat in us in Summer, is the air, which in that ſeaſon is much more hot then at any other times in the year, ſo the hotter the air is, the more we feel the heat. If then it be ſo, now cometh it that we find more coldneſſe and freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and leſſe heat in giving our ſelves air in ſummer, by fanning and moving it, when <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſaith, motion cauſeth greater heat; ſo that the air by this agitation, ought to be hot it ſelf, and heat us more than if it were left quiet and unmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>The cauſe proceeds from this, that we have more heat in our bodies, then there is in the air, as well naturally as what the air worketh in us. For the air coming freſhly, (I ſay freſhly becauſe it is more temperate then our ſelves) it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing tempers us, but being at reſt about us, it heats it ſelf by our heat as we have ſaid before of the ſtraw, it preſerves, nay augments this heat, howbeit if it be agitated and often renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in coming upon us more temperate than we are our ſelves,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:175728:61"/>this temperature and difference which we find of leſſe heat, moderates that which we have from our ſelves. This is the anſwer that <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Aristotle</hi> gives to this queſtion.</p>
               <p>We muſt notwithſtanding obſerve and note, That if the air be more hot than the heat which we have from our ſelves, the agitation and fanning of that air will not be ſo good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we ſhall find greater heat by ſo doing.</p>
               <p>So let us ſee now, to come again to hot water, If we put our hands into it, we ſhall have much ado to keep them in, yet if we hold our hands ſtill, we may endure it better than if we ſtir them up and down; becauſe the water which ſurrounds the cold hand tempers a little that which is about it, but in ſtirring it in the water, the water renews its heat, and begets every time new force.</p>
               <p>We may ask again, Why is it hotter in June and althrough July, the Sun being then farther from us, than at the beginning of June, when we are in the Solſtice and longeſt daies in the year, &amp; beats more right upon us with his rays. To which <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle</hi> anſwers in the ſecond of his Meteors, that the heat of the Sun is not the cauſe, nor do we feel it the more by being near to us, but when it hath the longer time to be over us; becauſe in June &amp; July, it hath had a longer time to draw near unto us, ſo in declining it cauſes a greater heat, for it heats again in its deſcent the part and track of the air which it had before heat by its riſing.</p>

                  <p>In what part of the Zodiack, the Sun, the Moon, and the reſt of the Planets were placed when they were made. And which was the beginning of years and times.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the Philoſopher ſaith, men are naturally curious to know, and again in this caſe, ſuch is their covetouſneſs &amp; greedy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of human underſtanding, that they content not themſelves alone, with the things that they comprehend with eaſe. But beyond that, they ſearch and ſtrive, with great preſumption, to know and underſtand impoſſible or very hard things, So it is neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe that this toilſome deſire, hath not been totally in vain, becauſe contemplation and continuall ſtudy hath found out things which have ſeemed impoſſible and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatuall to come to the knowledge of men, as are the motions of the Heavens, the courſe of the Planets and the Stars, with their power and influence, and ſuch like things. Amongſt which is comprehended that which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend now to treat of, which is to know, At what time of the year, and upon what day the world began. Or to ſpeak better, When and at what ſeaſon God created the world, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the time, and the year, or where was the Sun, or where did God firſt place it, when it began its courſe, and likewiſe the Moon and other Planets? <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> troubles himſelf lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle with theſe queſtions, no more doth a number of other Philoſophers, who for want of the light of faith, believe that the world was eternal and without beginning: yet thoſe that have not been ignorant of theſe things, but have believed this beginning of time, are almoſt divided in two opinions.</p>
               <p>Some amongſt them ſay, that at the inſtant when the world was created, the Sun was found in the firſt point of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:175728:62"/>the ſign of the Ram, which is in the ſummer Equinoxial, about the eleventh day of the moneth of March.</p>
               <p>Others ſay, that the world began, the Sun being in the firſt point of <hi>Libra,</hi> which is the winter Equinoxial, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly beginning the thirteenth or fourteenth of September. Of this opinion were ſome Egyptians and Arabians, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſome Greeks.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that follow that opinion alledge one reaſon, but at the laſt. I will ſhew how feeble and weak it is. For (ſay they) then the principal fruits of the earth were ripe and in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And alſo that it was reaſon, that the earth ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it ſelf at the beginning perfect, and to this purpoſe alledge the authority in <hi>Deuteronomie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 12.</note> where it is ſaid, <hi>God made all things perfect and furniſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There have been others which have ſaid, that the begining of time and years, was the longeſt day of all the reſt, which is then when the Sun enters in the ſign of <hi>Cancer,</hi> which is the eleventh or twelfth of June.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iulius Fermicus</hi> an ancient Author, and of great autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in Aſtrologie ſaith, that at the beginning of the world the Sun was at fifteen degrees of the Lion, which is the ſign in which it hath moſt Lordſhip, becauſe it is called the houſe of the Sun, and ſo he ſaith in diſcourſing upon other of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets. But the moſt reaſonable of all theſe opinions. And the moſt agreeing to truth is,</p>
               <p>That when time and the Heavens began to move, the Sun was in the firſt point of <hi>Aries,</hi> the Ram, which is to us in March, which is almoſt the beginning of Summer, which is affirmed (beſides thoſe reaſons which we will give) by the greateſt part of Hiſtoriographers, as well Chriſtians as Ethnicks, amongſt which are St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> and others, all which place the beginning of the world, and of the year in the Equinoxiall of our ſummer, and although there ſeemeth to be ſome difference amongſt them. Becauſe one will have this beginning to be in <hi>March,</hi> and the other will have it in <hi>April,</hi> that may be born
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:175728:62"/>with; for they both agree that it was in the Equinoxial which now is in March. Nevertheleſſe as we have ſaid heretofore, the Equinoxiall is not conſtant, for our Saviour Chriſt, ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the five and twentieth of March, which was then the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoxiall, and now it is the eleventh; And therefore it may be ſuppoſed that heretofore it was in <hi>April:</hi> for this cauſe ſome have put <hi>April</hi> for the firſt moneth, and others <hi>March,</hi> and yet they would all ſay; that when the Sun enters into the firſt point of <hi>Aries,</hi> that is the Equinoxiall: and this opinion is founded upon the holy Scripture, namely out of the twelfth Chapter of <hi>Exodus,</hi> where it is ſaid that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth <hi>Niſan,</hi> which is our <hi>March,</hi> is the beginning of their year. Alſo <hi>Vincent</hi> ſaith, that the Hebrews began their year in <hi>March.</hi> becauſe in that moneth is the Equinoxiall, where the world began.</p>
               <p>This opinion is likewiſe held of divers Heathens, as <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paco</hi> in his Treatiſe of Aſtrologie, where he ſaith, that the Caldeans, who were very great Aſtrologers, believed alſo, that the firſt day in which the world was created, the Sun en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the firſt point of the ſign of <hi>Aries,</hi> which is alſo maintained by the greateſt part of Aſtrologers, as well Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent as Modern. When therefore the Sun joins himſelf there, that is the beginning of the year, and from thence comes the beginning or firſt day. For it is very clear, that the firſt day of the world was made the firſt day of the year, ſeeing that before, there was neither time nor year; for this cauſe the ſign of <hi>Aries</hi> is of all accounted the firſt in the order of the twelve ſigns.</p>
               <p>And as to judge of the revolution of years, and of things to come, it is neceſſary to even the figures, by the beginning of the world, ſo is it eaſie to prove, that God placed the Sun in the firſt point of this ſign, at the beginning of the world, and the creation thereof, which may be more eaſily imagined, by that which we have proved in a former Chapter. That the Sun was in the ſame point at the Creation then, when the great Sun, framed the re-generation of the world, ſuffering death in humane fleſh, which came to paſſe, as we have ſaid, in this
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:175728:63"/>Equinoxial of Summer, which is an Argument and preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, that he placed it ſo then when he created it.</p>
               <p>Again, it ſeems credible, that it hath been ſo placed, becauſe thoſe that know any thing in Aſtrologie and the Sphears, will ſee very well, that the Sun entring the degree of this Sign, and performing his revolution in the ſpace of one whole day, there is no part of the world but ſeeth it, and is illuminated by his light, which is not performed in any other part of the Zodiack; becauſe in what other part ſoever it be, there is ſome part of the earth where it is not ſeen: But being in this firſt point, as we have ſaid, there is not any place which is not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened in making his days courſe.</p>
               <p>Now it was convenient and fit, that the firſt day that the Sun ſhould run his compaſſe, he ſhould begin in ſuch a place, that with his beams he might viſit all the parts of the world: &amp; that this ſhould be rather in the Sign of <hi>Aries,</hi> than <hi>Libra,</hi> appears by that which I have ſaid, That the day of the Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Saviour, the Sun was in the ſame place, and hath alſo in that Sign a perticular force.</p>
               <p>Holding then this opinion for the moſt certain, I ſay the reaſon alledged by thoſe that ſay, The beginning of the world was in the September Equinoxial, is weak: Nor doth it help them to ſay, that all fruits were then ripe, and in ſeaſon; becauſe that is not an univerſal rule; for when fruit is ripe towards the latitude of the North, it is not ſo in the South, but quite contrary. And for this cauſe I will not help my ſelf with their reaſons, that ſay, the Epuinoxial in March (which I approve of) is the beginning of the Spring time and growth of flowers over all the earth, and that all things then increaſe; for if to us it be the beginning of Spring time, it is Winter to them in the Southern parts.</p>
               <p>Let our reaſons then ſuffice, and the authority of ſuch great perſons, and let none be longer in doubt, ſeeing that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane year which is in uſe, begins likewiſe the firſt day of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary; for this came to paſſe by the ſuperſtitious devotion which the Gentiles had to their God <hi>Ianus,</hi> and would have
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:175728:63"/>their year begin with his name, as the Chriſtians begin theirs at the birth of Jeſus Chriſt, although there the year begins not. So the Romans began the yeer in March, as <hi>Varro</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crobius</hi> writes, and divers others.</p>
               <p>So God ſhewed his large bounty, and infinite goodneſſe, in placing our firſt Parents, <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in the Northern parts of the earth, when he baniſhed them out of the Earthly Paradice; for the firſt ſeaſon that they ſaw in the world, was the Spring time, when they found the Earth green and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing, and the Air ſweet and temperate; and this was for a conſolation to their miſery and nakedneſſe, which they would not have found, had it not been Spring time.</p>
               <p>Now this being ſufficiently proved, let us know that there are other Planets; and firſt the Moon, as one of the principals: which ſome ſay the firſt day that it was created, God placed it in conjunction with the Sun. Others ſay that it was in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and that it was at full. Saint <hi>Auguſtiue</hi> recites both theſe two opinions, upon Geneſis the fifth Chapter. And faith, That thoſe that maintain, that it was in oppoſition, and at full, give for their reaſon, That it was not convenient that at it's beginning God ſhould create it defective in any thing.</p>
               <p>Others ſay the contrary, That it is rather to be believed, that it was created in the firſt day of the Moon, than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. But to make ſhort, I ſay, according to my opinion, That God when he created it, made it entirely full, and in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Sun; and ſo it ſeems that this opinion is moſt recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> in the place alledged, and <hi>Raban</hi> upon the eleventh chapter of Exodus, ſay the ſame: and they agree with the holy Scripture, where it is ſaid, God made two Lights: one great to govern the day, the other leſſe to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the night.</p>
               <p>Now at the ſame inſtant that the Sun begins to ſhew his light, he enlightens half the world, ſo that in half the world it is day: but the other half cannot have the light of the Sun, becauſe of the ſhadow of the Earth.</p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:175728:64"/>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe it ſeems reaſonable, that in the other half of the Earth where it is night, the Moon do her office of giving light; becauſe as they were both created at one and the ſame inſtant, ſo do they both their office at one and the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and one rules the day, and the other the night, as the Text ſaith; for then was verified the words of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>And the world was enlightened throughout.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And on the contrary, If the Moon had been in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that could not be but fifteen days after, and there would have been three or four days paſt before ſhe could have given light to the Earth, although this had been but little, as we ſee when ſhe is four or five days old: Wherefore it is conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that theſe two lights enlighten the Earth at one and the ſame time.</p>
               <p>I ſay further, That if the Moon had been in oppoſition of the Sun, of neceſſity ſhe muſt be found one the other ſide, in the ſign of <hi>Libra:</hi> which being ſo, ſhe works that day the ſame effect of the Sun, enlightening all the world, in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that ſhe makes her courſe that day, which ſhe could not do if ſhe were in any other place, by means whereof this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſeems to be moſt likely. Although <hi>Tulius Firmicus</hi> would ſay, That the Moon when it was created, had her firſt ſeat in the fifteenth Degree of the ſign of <hi>Cancer,</hi> where ſhe loves beſt to be. Of which opinion is <hi>Macrobius,</hi> in his firſt book of <hi>Scipio</hi>'s Dream.</p>
               <p>As for other Planets, It would be more difficult to avouch, and leſſe profitable to know; therefore I mean not to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy much time about them. Howſoever <hi>Iulius Firmicus</hi> in the ſecond book before alledged, hath the boldneſſe to name the places where every one of them were ſeated: ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Saturn</hi> was in <hi>Capricorn, Iupiter</hi> in the ſign of <hi>Sagit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarius, Mars</hi> in <hi>Scorpio, Venus</hi> in <hi>Libra, Mercury</hi> in <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi> which are the ſigns in which they have moſt force; and ſo are they the ſigns denoted of theſe Planets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Macrobius</hi> in the alledged book of <hi>Scipio</hi>'s Dream, agrees with <hi>Firmicus,</hi> and names the ſame ſigns. And ſo there are
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:175728:64"/>others which think, that at this inſtant all the Planets are in conjunction with the Sun.</p>
               <p>As for me, I am of opinion that God placed then the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets in ſuch diſtant places one from the other, and eſpecially from the Sun, that at that day every one of them might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten the earth with their Beams, which could not be, if they were in conjunction with the Sun; becauſe his preſence, in a certain diſtance and proportion hinders, that their Raies and light cannot be ſeen upon the earth. Nevertheleſſe, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been created by the wil of God, it is ſufficient (as St <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> ſaith) that they were made in a perfect eſtate by the hand of God, whoſe works, of what ſort ſoever, are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>

               <p>Sleep is a repoſe, and reſt of all the ſences, and proceeds from vapours and fumes, which by reaſon of meat, riſe from the ſtomack to the Brain, by the coldneſſe of which, theſe hot vapours are tempered, and ſet to ſleep the motion and exteriour ſences.</p>

               <p>Of theſe occaſions of Sleep, <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> treateth largely in his book of ſleep and watching. And <hi>Plutarch</hi> recites divers opinions of Philoſophers.

               <p>Now too much ſleep (beſides that it make the ſences and the members heavy and ſluggiſh, and infeebled by lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) breedeth ſo much humidity in the body, that it maketh it ſick and diſeaſed, and kills; for ſleeping, all the humidities in the body retires with the naturall heat to the exteriour parts and makes no evacuation of its ſuperfluities and moiſtures. So that immoderate ſleep is not onely forbidden by Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians and Philoſophers, but reproved by wiſe men. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, while we ſleep there is no difference betwixt a wiſe man and a fool.</p>
               <p>And in truth, although the wiſe man hath no other reaſon to ſhorten his ſleep, but, not to make himſelf like to him that hath no wit, yet he ought to abridge it (although it ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain and keep life and health) conſidering that he which ſleeps
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:175728:65"/>is not alive, As <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaith, in his book of ſtrife betwixt fire and water. He that ſleeps hath no more ſtrength nor knowledge while he ſleeps, than if he were dead. <hi>Pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Ovid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and divers other Poets and learned men call ſleep the ſimilitude of death. And in the holy Scripture ſlep is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to death. St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, [I would not have you to be ignorant, Brethren, concerning them which ſleep:] and a little after. [God will bring along with him thoſe that ſleep by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.]</p>
               <p>Sleep is likewiſe the Image of negligence and ſlothfulneſſe. The ſame Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth it ſaying, <hi>Brethren it is now time to awake out of Sleep.</hi> It ſignifies alſo ſin and guilt, as St <hi>Gregorie</hi> ſaith, <hi>That to ſleep is to hold and perſevere in ſin.</hi> If ſleep had not been taken for ſin, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> would not have ſaid ſo many times, <hi>Awake ye Iuſt and fin no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let that man then be aſhamed that ſpends moſt part of his life in bed and ſleep; for he ſinneth no leſſe then he that ſits all the day long at the table to eat, ſeeing that theſe things ought to be uſed, for the ſuſtentation of life, and not for the the damage or hurt of it, and of the ſoul alſo.</p>
               <p>So then ſleep ought to be taken for the ſupport of the body and not for pleaſure. And ſeeing we muſt imploy it onely to the health of the body, let us now know in what manner a man ought to lay himſelf in his bed to ſleep, that it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable unto him.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid that the beſt ſleeping for a man in good order, and ſound, is, to lie, during his firſt ſleep, upon his right ſide, and then the moſt part of the night upon the left. And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concluſion of your ſleep, to turn a little upon the right again.</p>
               <p>The reaſon is, becauſe the ſtomack of man is ſcituated ſo, that the mouth of it is a little more towards the right ſide
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:175728:66"/>then towards the left, and the bottome of it hollow declining ſomething towards the left ſide. So that a man laying him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſleep upon the right ſide an hour or two, the ſtomack ſpreads it ſelf, and lies upon the liver: and from thence proceeds two benefits. The one is, that the ſtomack is ſet right, and being ſet right, the meat deſcends more eaſily to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, That the moiſtneſſe of the meat refreſheth the Liver, and with this refreſhment the naturall heat takes force in the ſtomack to begin to make digeſtion. After theſe two good effects have taken their turn, it would be good to turn upon the other ſide, becauſe in ſo turning, the Liver comes to cover the ſtomack, and to embrace it with its skirts, ſo that the meat is reteined by the Liver, and digeſtion per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs it is good, towards the concluſion of ſleep to turn again upon the right ſide, that the ſtomack may begin to be ſet ſtreight again, and be diſcharged of the Liver, and to expell the air, or ſuperfluity of the forepaſſed digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>This Rule is good and well known to him, whoſe Liver is temperate, and ſtomack not could, and he who hath theſe two members ſound and temperate.</p>
               <p>But for him that hath the Liver too hot, and the ſtomack cold, as it happens often times, it is not good to ſleep upon the right ſide, for the ſtomack falling upon the Liver, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing it on all ſides; it inflames and heats the Liver extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and the ſtomack being left uncovered, as uppermoſt, is made more cold: beſides, the great heat that is in the Liver, takes away and draws to it ſelf, that little heat which is in the ſtomack, from whence proceeds an ill digeſtion and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently an il habit and unhealthfulneſs.</p>
               <p>Wherefore for him that ſhall have a cold ſtomack and a hot Liver, it will be healthfull for him to ſleep alwaies upon the left ſide, becauſe the ſtomack being on all ſides covered with the Liver, it makes its digeſtion. And as for the Liver be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:175728:66"/>ſo uppermoſt it is uncovered, and disburthened, and by that means is refreſhed and not enflamed.</p>
               <p>There are alſo ſome that ſleep upon their belly, which helps and ſtrengthens digeſtion, becauſe it gathers together, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teins naturall beat in the parts about the ſtomack, and ſo is in better diſpoſition to evacuate the ſuperfluities.</p>
               <p>The contrary of which happens to them that ſleep upon their back, with their face uppermoſt; becauſe the naturall heat ſpreads abroad, and by that means digeſtion is weakned, and the ſuperfluities cannot be voided by the mouth nor by the ordinary courſes, but reſts in the Breaſt and the Throat, which cauſes many times, Stopping, Palſies, and other infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</p>
               <p>Underſtanding men again adviſe not to ſleep, with the Lims ſtretched out in bed, becauſe it weakens diſgeſtion. For according to the Philoſopher, when the virtues and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are united together the operation will be the better. And then being ſo moderately heaped together, the fleſhy part which covers the ſtomack, joins better to it, and heats it, and ſtrengthens it the more.</p>
               <p>Theſe Rules are neceſſary for thoſe that are tender and weak. But for the healthfull and luſty, the beſt Rule is, for him to obſerve and keep the cuſtome that he hath alwaies uſed.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that all men are ſubject once to die, and in that all men are alike: Nevertheleſſe, there is difference in the terms of life, for one liveth longer and another a ſhorter time, and yet according to <hi>Job</hi> the time of our life is meaſured, and it is not poſſible for man to paſſe the bounds which God hath ſet and determined for our life. Things ſtanding ſo as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are, it will not be amiſſe to underſtand that which cauſes in the life of man, why one liveth longer than another; and what complexions makes beſt for a long life: and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how we ſhall underſtand that where it is ſaid, that our daies are numbred and determined, and that it is not poſſible to go beyond that, which are obſcure and difficult points and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood but of few people.</p>
               <p>To underſtand therefore that which concerns the length of our life.</p>
               <p>We muſt preſuppoſe in the firſt place, that the life of man and the maintenance of the humane body, conſiſts in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and harmony of the four elements or elementary quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties whereof it is compoſed. That is to ſay, hot, cold, moiſt, and dry.</p>
               <p>And expreſſely in the proportionable harmony of heat and moiſture, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> well demonſtrates who makes one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:175728:67"/>mention of the agreement of theſe two qualities, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of man.</p>
               <p>So we ſee by experience that man fails not ſo long as he hath naturall heat, for this heat is the principall inſtrument that maintains the vegetative ſpirit.</p>
               <p>And indeed the life of man conſiſts in no other thing, than in maintaining the Inſtruments and Organs of the Soul, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which naturall heat holds by good right the firſt rank. For this heat is ſo neceſſary for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> maintenance of a humane body, that it failing, the ſoul is conſtrained to forſake the body, and put an end to the life of that man.</p>
               <p>And becauſe this naturall heat holds of fire, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes of its own nature all that it meets withall, it is convenient to oppoſe it, by an other contrary quality, for the preſervation of inferiour bodies.</p>
               <p>For this cauſe God placed the Radicall or naturall moiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure with this naturall heat to nouriſh and maintain it, even as the fire is nouriſhed and maintained with oil.</p>
               <p>And becauſe this Radicall moiſture conſumes and diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es daily, to maintain the ſame, all living creatures muſt drink and eat, that ſo by that means, the moiſture cauſed by that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion may ſupply the default of nature.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing that (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſaith) the moiſture cauſed of that digeſtion, is never ſo perfect as the Radicall and naturall although it ſerve much to maintain it, of neceſſity this Radicall moiſture diminiſheth daily (for the accidentall moiſture cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by digeſtion, is never ſo perfect as the Radicall which is vaniſhed) and by this means vaniſhing totally the naturall heat is loſt, and the body finiſheth its end; for if the Radicall moiſture cauſed of this digeſtion, were as perfect as the naturall moiſture which is vaniſhed, man would live endleſly (as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines ſay) who maintain, that the nature of the Tree of life, which God placed in the earthly Paradice conſiſted princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally in this, that eating of its fruit, it reſtored the Radical moiſture which would have been loſt and vaniſhed. From
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:175728:68"/>thence it came that this Tree was prohibited to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> after they were driven out of Paradice. But if our firſt Parents had continued in their originall righteouſneſs, they and their Poſterity eating of the fruit of that Tree, would have lived eternally in flouriſhing youth, without taſting cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, or old age, untill God had glorified their bodies, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paſſing through the gate of death.</p>
               <p>But ſeeing that humane Race loſt this Prerogative by ſin, which hath brought in death into the world, it is no marvell if this offence be ſtamped upon us.</p>
               <p>Now to return to our diſcourſe. I ſay the life laſts long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or ſhorter, according as heat, and Radicall moiſture are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordant and proportionable. For thoſe in whom theſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities meet moſt tempered, and beſt proportioned live longeſt. And not thoſe in whom the ſaid qualities moſt abound. From thence it comes that we ſee, many ſmal creatures, who have but little heat and moiſture, live longer than thoſe that are greater, and abound more in the ſaid qualities; which happens as well to Trees as men.</p>
               <p>So that we may ſay, long life conſiſts in the temperature and juſt proportion of heat and moiſture, which failing, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that is to ſay, life, is diſſolved and loſt. For when heat ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth moiſture, it conſumes in a ſhort time the whole body, as we may ſee in chollerick men.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, when by exceſſive moiſture the heat is extinguiſhed, as we ſee in phlegmatick perſons, the like hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens.</p>
               <p>By this neuertheleſſe, we muſt not underſtand, that there ought to be as much moiſture as heat. But it is meet, that the proportion be obſerved; that is to ſay, that the heat ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe the moiſture proportionably.</p>
               <p>For a thing active, hath no great power to work upon an other, if it exceed not the thing paſſive, which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertly demonſtrates, when he ſaith, that amongſt the two qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities before ſpoken of, there ought to be ſome litle coldneſſe mingled to moderate the heat of the Radicall fire, that it may
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:175728:68"/>not wholly conſume the naturall moiſture. And that drought is alſo requiſite, to drie up the Radicall moiſture, that it may not quench the naturall fire, as we ſee it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten happens to little children, who die of too much moiſture. Yet amongſt theſe four qualities the hot and the moiſt are held for the principals, as being vitall complexions, and cauſing life.</p>
               <p>As for the cold and the dry, although they ſerve greatly for the preſervation of life, yet nevertheleſs, we hold theſe two qualities to be the entrance to, and beginning of death. For cold is an enemy to heat, in which principally conſiſts the point of life. And drought is oppoſite and contrary to moiſture, which nouriſheth nevertheleſs the naturall heat.</p>
               <p>So we may ſee in old folks, which become dry and cold, when they approach near unto death; nay even in all dead bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which ordinarily are dry and cold.</p>
               <p>Man then, Heaven working this good temperature, ought to ſeaſon his complexion amongſt theſe four qualities, in ſuch ſort, that he maintain the heat in the firſt place, and after that the moiſture making the cold and the dry to ſerve, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their function and quarter. Even ſo, thoſe that find themſelves not thus proportionably temperate are naturally ſhort lived.</p>
               <p>See here then the cauſes of long and ſhort life.</p>
               <p>It reſts now to ſpeak of, which is the beſt complexion to ſhew long life.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place then, we muſt note, that of the four com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions in man, to wit, cholerick, ſanguine, phlegmatick and melancholy, the ſanguine is the beſt to cauſe a man to live long.</p>
               <p>For the bloud is hot and moiſt, which qualities are proper to maintain life. Alſo its moiſture is not wateriſh, but airy, being hot and moiſt, and ſorts with the ſanguine complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion.</p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:175728:69"/>
               <p>And ſo this Sanguine Complexion participating ſomething of the temperate heat, and a ſufficient moiſture to nouriſh the heat, is the moſt proper of all the complexions to conduce to long life.</p>
               <p>As for the Cholerick, that continues leſſe, becauſe the force and vivacity of its fire and heat, cannot long endure with the drought</p>
               <p>The Phlegmatick and wateriſh cannot be digeſted by the heat, becauſe of it exceſſive moiſture, and ſo it eaſily corrupts, which in the end cauſes death.</p>
               <p>The Melancholy, being earthy, ſhortens the life by its cold diſpoſition and drineſſe, which are contrary quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to heat and moiſture. Wherefore it is not marvel if they ſhorten the life, where they abound in any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe, if choler be mingled with phlegme, and that it do ſurmount proportionably the phlegme, this complexion is abiding enough to yeeld long life. Alſo when the bloud ſurpaſſes melancholy in a good proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this complexion is good; for the heat and moiſture of the bloud, tempers the cold, and drineſſe of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy.</p>
               <p>And ſo there are compounded complexions, which are much better then the ſimple Sanguine, to yeeld long life.</p>
               <p>By that which is aforeſaid, we may ſee that the life of man is limited, by the virtue and power of his complexion, and by the proportion of the elementary qaalities, in ſuch fort, that the diverſity of proportions cauſe a diverſity of termes or time to the life of man.</p>
               <p>So it is ſaid, that a man may live as long as his naturall heat laſteth, and Radicall moiſture is maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>And whereas it is ſaid, that the life of man is limited, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond which it is unpoſſible to paſſe. We muſt note, that
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:175728:69"/>although the complexion and naturall perfection of a man may bring him and ſupport him, even to the laſt period, yet nevertheleſſe, of a thouſand ſcarce one attains to that point.</p>
               <p>For there are ſo many diſaſters which accidentally happen, either by ſome diſorder, that the moſt part die be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nature fails them, be it, by Famine, Plague, Poiſon, Gluttony, Whoredome, ill diet; or by diſeaſes, cauſed by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite exceſs.</p>
               <p>And ſo the true naturall term of the life of man, is, when nature fails, ſo that it is unpoſſible to paſſe that point of time.</p>
               <p>And ſo we muſt underſtand that paſſage in <hi>Iob,</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>Lord, thou hast eſtabliſhed the bounds which it is unpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for him to go beyond.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this paſſage we may clearly ſee, that man may ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en his life, but not lengthen it. So that we ſee many of good complexion that might live a great number of years, which nevertheleſſe are ſhort lived, by ſome exteriour cauſe, which haſtens their days.</p>
               <p>Yet this paſſage of <hi>Iob</hi> may be otherwiſe underſtood, in regard of Gods foreknowledge, who appoints to every one the term of hit life, be it by his naturall complexion, or by ſome other end, that he hath aſſigned to the life of man.</p>
               <p>And becauſe there is nothing hidden from the wiſedome of God who knows all the accidentall cauſes, which may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to man it is impoſſible for man to lengthen his life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what God hath ordeined, although the cauſes be contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</p>
               <p>And ſo one may ſay, there are two terms of a mans life. The one whereof depends upon the Harmony, and proportion of the elementary qualities. The other is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the preordination, and fore-knowledge of God.</p>
               <p>Between which terms there is onely this difference; that
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:175728:70"/>one may arrive even at the firſt, though not go beyond it; But all come to the ſecond. And although by courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, one may paſſe the ſecond, yet nevertheleſs, there is none that ever paſſeth it.</p>

But mans weakneſs (or to ſay rather) the faith of man is ſo weak, that when it is preached unto him, the glory that God hath provided for him hereafter, he will ſay, he beleeveth it.</p>
               <p>But nevertheleſs he will ſay, it is a great matter of ſo many men that are dead, there is not one returned to tell us the things of the other world.</p>
               <p>The greateſt ſign of unbelief in the heart of man is (in my judgement) this great deſire to have revelations from the other world.

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:175728:70"/>means of our Salvation were taken from us.</p>
               <p>Again, I ſay further, That not onely by this Revelation Faith would be deſtroyed; but alſo it would be an occaſion to make us run into great errours againſt God, as we may eaſily judge by this argument.</p>
               <p>Put the caſe, that our Father, Mother, or Brother, after death ſhould return into this world, and were cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſame fleſh they had left behind them, and that we ſhould certainly beleeve they were the ſame, and that they ſhould be converſant, drink, and eat with us, as our Saviour did with his Apoſtles, that they might not be in doubt he was a Spirit, or a Shadow; and that this our Brother, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould reveal unto us the things of the other world, there were no doubt but we ſhould heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to him, and without all queſtion beleeve that whidh he ſays to be true.</p>
               <p>Now this muſt be a man, becauſe he hath Soul and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and beleeving him, we beleeve a man, which by nature a Liar.</p>
